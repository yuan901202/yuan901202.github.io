Essay OneTopic: How can metaphors be used as a research tool? What are the advantages and disadvantages of using metaphors for research? Elaborate and justify a metaphor for the use of social media such as Facebook.Lecturer’s Name: Tiong Goh &amp; Kristijan MirkovskiDate: 21st June, 2017Word Count: 1532IntroductionMetaphor as a cognitive phenomenon, and it has extremely extensive impact on human thinking, artistic creation, and language use. Metaphor based on another experience to understand and experience a thing. Specifically, through the comparison of similar attributes, metaphor often uses familiar, simple, concrete, intuitive, well-known concept or thing to explain and describe another new, complex, abstract, unknown concept or thing. The purpose of using metaphor is making the concept or thing easier be identified, communicated, understand and remember. It probably says metaphor is the mapping between the real world and the abstract world. Using metaphors in research could provide a unique opportunity to understand the actual phenomenon within research experiments. The use of metaphors as a research tool could help researchers reduce a huge amount of resources to easily clarify their ideas in context. Neergaard &amp; Ulhøi (2006) introduced that there have four advantages and four disadvantages if using metaphors in a research. The advantages of using metaphors including: firstly, using metaphors could inspire people think different ways, for example, the function of metaphor is make complex thing simple, which it can help people think more creativity. Secondly, using metaphors could help readers easily to understand the research, because metaphor is usually a phase that everyone could understand. Thirdly, using metaphor could attract people to read, for example, the first sentence in an introduction should capture readers attention, and attract readers want to read more about this topic. Finally, using metaphor could help the article influence the people’s emotion, because metaphor could have multi-layer meanings. The result is using metaphor not only to help researchers better express what they want to present, but also can help readers to gain a better understanding of the article. On the other hand, the disadvantages of using metaphors including: firstly, using metaphors could make researcher confused about the topic, because if researcher misuse the metaphors, it will cause misleading people’s point of view. Secondly, using metaphors may make the topic difficult to understand, because use metaphor in research is not focus on the topic, and it normally used to help reader to understand. Thirdly, using metaphors might attractive enough to let readers want to read, but it might let readers feel that this article is not the article they want, because it did not show the subject of the study at the beginning. Finally, using metaphors might lead to less focus on the topic, and probably have poor logic in the article. DiscussionIn my opinion, we could use metaphors as an artefact in research, or we could use it as an inspiration tool to inspire researcher creative thinking of the topic. In addition, we could use metaphors as a presentation tool to quickly express the ideas. However, how about using metaphor in social media, what is social media like, and how we could feel to be part of it. Social media, or social network, which stands for a group of people with the same interests and activities to create an online community. Such network often based on the Internet to provide users with a variety of contacts and exchanges with other users, such as e-mail, instant messaging services, and sharing information. As a result, the metaphor for social media (like Facebook) is like a Christmas party, where everyone invited to the party, in other words, friend’s friends are friends. People can relax their bodies and minds though parties, and play with their friends. Meanwhile, the parties provides many opportunities for various people in the social life. People can make different friends on the party, usually these friends have different culture, in the way people can learn more from different regions of the people’s culture and living customs. In the research study, Gorry &amp; Scott-Morton (1989) indicated that an effective framework could improve information systems efforts, in other words, use a proper framework for management information system (MIS) is the main challenge for the organization. They also shows that strategic planning, management control, and operational control are the main framework for analysis process in order to develop an effective information system within the organization. For social media study, a proper framework to study such object is necessary, and it is more like a guide to teach people how to get into the party. The function of party is to create a public environment to let people know each other’s and become a friend. Firstly, people get together to know each other’s, and then they normally will form a group of people, most of the people in this group are friends who know each other. Alternatively, they do not know each other, but they have the same interests and hobbies, or they just from the same school or company. Thirdly, they gather around within the party, and they share information to others within the group. The content of information is usually include, name, birth of year, schools, company, interests, and so on. In addition, Hirschheim &amp; Newman (1991) indicated that using metaphor in research is to describe the relationship between technology and users, and metaphor as a way to understand a thing in different way (or easier way). For example, they take information as a structured data, and take organization as an information. They shows that two scenarios to describe the relationship between technology and users: “technology as tool and man as craftsman” is used in an optimistic scenario, and “technology as governor and man as machine” is used in an pessimistic scenario (pp. 38-39). Both of these two scenarios are present the relationship between technology and users is like master and slave, like technology is master, and users are slave. They also shows that three metaphors widely used in Information Systems Development (ISD), which includes “Information Systems Development as a battle”, “organizations as fiefdoms”, and “man as machine” (pp. 49-50). In this case, if people have a social media account, they will ask to add friend, even they do not each other. This is explain how friend’s friends are friends’ works. People use technology to strengthen the relationship between peoples, but this relationship built above on the social media, In other words, they are actually virtual friends. On the other hand, Kendall &amp; Kendall (1993) shows that here has nigh metaphors in information systems, such as journey, war, game, organism, society, machine, family, zoo, and jungle. They also shows that one of function using metaphors in information system research is to help researcher develop a corporate strategy link to IT development in the organization. They also points our using metaphor is to describe one object as another, which make people easily to understand an unfamiliar item. They also listed five assumption of metaphors, (1) metaphor is the foundation of the English language; (2) basic metaphor needs someone else; (3) metaphor help us conceptualize some things in certain ways; (4) metaphors are usually kept constant, and have the basic form of experience; and (5) some inconsistent metaphors could be explain with different areas of experience. For the metaphor of the social media, party is like a small society, people exchange thoughts about an interesting topic. Moreover, Walsham (1991) shows that here has eight organizational metaphors concerning information systems practice, which take the organization as “machines, organisms, brains, cultures, political systems, psychic prisons, flux and transformation, and instruments of domination” (p. 83). He also indicated that organizational metaphors also related to the study of information systems. Social media also could explained with organizational metaphors, for instance, Walsham think organization as cultures, but we could also think social media as cultures, like discussed before, people in the party usually with different culture background, they will share their personal experience to others, and this allow people to understand particular things in distinctive ways. Like when I first came to New Zealand, my lecturer encourage me to take birthday or Christmas parties to understand what Kiwi culture is, there is no doubt through parties could help me learn English to quickly get into different cultures and also get to know more friends. ConclusionsThe importance of metaphor in the research can be debated, but what is fact is that there were many benefits using metaphor in the research that help people to know the topic quickly, and to help people quickly get into the scene of experiment. The case of social media that we discussed is social media is like a Christmas party, which let people to share their thoughts or information to others, to engage with others, and to talk about topic that fit the current situation. Social media, like Facebook, people could share their information to public or just to friends, and they could re-share other’s post. This makes the dissemination of information more extensive and faster. People within social media is more like every individual node within the network, where network is the connection link to keep people together. Like a party we talked before, it used to strengthen the connection between peoples. However, using party as metaphor for social media is not a proper way to describe, because there have different kind of social media exists on the network. Researcher may use a metaphor to one specific social media, but not for entire social media system. ReferencesGorry, G. A., &amp; Scott-Morton, Michael M.S. (1989).

List and discuss three of each advantages and disadvantages of these measurement approaches? Are these measures influenced by the mobility of the system? Provide examples to justify your answers.Lecturer’s Name: Tiong Goh &amp; Kristijan MirkovskiDate: 21st June, 2017Word Count: 1520IntroductionHow to measure IS adoption/implementation success is become a major problem in information system field. There have two ways to measure how success of IS adoption or implementation: one is to measure the performance of IS itself, and another is to measure IS on the impact of corporate performance and evaluation of the results. In my experience, I would use IS performance to measure the success of IS adoption, because it probably the best way to test the adoption is success or not. The advantages of using IS performance to measure IS success is: (1) IS performance is based on the conversation between manager and employee, and it will help solve the issue very quickly, because manager could directly know where the problem is. (2) Encourage employee to work harder, because celebration of IS success could encourage employee to make the best effort at workplace. (3) Provide a structured process to both manager and employee to discuss any issues within the organization. However, thing always have double sides, the disadvantages of using IS performance to measure IS success is include: (1) the process of performance measurement is required lots of time to implement, the organization or manager should well managed the time to evaluate the process. (2) The process may discourage employee, because if there has many issues been found during the evaluation process, it has the potential to discourage employees. (3) The process of measurement should well designed without any mistakes, because if the process did not done properly, it could create a negative experience and waste time. In this essay, we will talk about how to measure IS adoption/implementation success in the organization, and we will discuss how to implement this measurement to real business case. DiscussionWe use IS performance to measure how IS adoption/implementation is success or not, which the measurement is used at the end of IS development in the organization. Such measurement will not influenced by the mobility of system, because performance measurement is based on to measure the process and results, the process of running is to improve the organization’s goal by effectively configure the information resources, and the running results refers to the contribution of the application of information system to the realization of the organization’s goal. An example of measure Brazilian financial institution by implement the method of performance measurement, the researchers shows that the role of CIO should manage all activities that related to IT, and also they should also build a relationship between IT and organization strategy. These measurements based on survey model, the questions asked in survey is relate to relevance and success of IT results. The questions are consists four parts: cost/benefit, growth, asset and flexibility (Barbosa, Rodello &amp; De Padua, 2014). In addition, DeLone and McLean IS Success Model was the first model to measure IS success in information system field. William &amp; Ephraim (2003) introduced use “‘system quality’ measure technical success, ‘information quality’ measure semantic success; and ‘use, user satisfaction, individual impacts,’ and ‘organizational impacts’ measure effectiveness success” in the DeLone and McLean IS Success Model (p. 10). These six dimensions are dependent, because the level of IS success should measure by all six dimensions, each dimension is measure one aspect of IS adoption or implementation. More specifically, “frequency of use, time of use, number of accesses, usage pattern, and dependency” used to measure system use. In addition, “ease of use, functionality, reliability, flexibility, data quality, portability, integration, and importance” used to measure system quality. Furthermore, information quality measured by “accuracy, timeliness, completeness, relevance, and consistency”. Moreover, individual impact measured by “job performance, job effectiveness, decision-making performance, quality of work environment and job performance” (pp. 13-15). The model was based on D&amp;M IS success Model to discuss how to measure IS success, there included six categories to define success of IS implementation (see Figure 1). It clearly examined how to measure IS adoption success by implement this six methods. Figure 1: IS success metrics Moreover, Gable, Sedera &amp; Chan (2008) stated that system quality and information quality is used to measure the IS implementation success by using the IS-Impact Measurement Model. For system quality, it includes data accuracy, data currency, database contents, ease of use, ease of learning, access, user requirements, system features, system accuracy, flexibility, reliability, efficiency, sophistication, integration, and customisation. For information quality, it includes importance, availability, usability, understandability, relevance, format, content accuracy, conciseness, timeliness, and uniqueness. On the other hand, Tate, Sedera, McLean &amp; Burton-Jones (2014) indicated that type of the system and the scope of the system in IS should be considered during system evaluation, because it could affect perceptions of success. For example, people may not have such knowledge to notice the mistakes or errors in the information systems. They also shows that two popular forms of measure IS adoption success, which is self-report and user perception. They also indicated that “just ask someone” is probably a directly way to measure success of information systems (p. 5). Moreover, they also shows that service quality could also use to measure success of IS adoption, which using service to determine how IS implementation is successes within the organization. Finally, they points out measure by effective communication with stakeholders and they set a clear goal for IS project at the beginning. Moreover, Thong (1999) indicated that he use an integrated model to measure how success of information system adoption in a small business, which include four different characteristics: decision-maker, information systems, organization, and environment. Decision-maker in this case is for the role of CEO in the organization, and he shows that CEO should have ability use innovative solution to solve problems, and CEO should have basic IS knowledge to implement new technology in the organization. For information system characteristics, it should have be know better about IS attributes, because compatibility is one of major problem in the process of IS adoption. For organizational characteristics, it measured by size of business, employees’ IS knowledge, and information intensity. For environmental characteristics, competition is used to measure IS adoption, which competition is associated with adoption rates, in other words, higher adoption means it got strong competition. From the strategic analysis of the organization, IT investment return and strategy implementation should be the most concerned about the topic. IT high risk and high failure rate requires the organization make the right decision before investment. It should conduct a fair strategic positioning, comprehensive demonstration of the advanced technology and feasibility of the project, the implementation of financial possibilities, the application of fairness and effectiveness. Compared with the traditional performance evaluation, information performance evaluation have a higher complexity. The indicators of traditional project value evaluation are more easily be quantified, the ultimate evaluation is relatively easy, its benefits are mainly reflected in the dominant income, and IT application could affect by many variables. Therefore, the performance evaluation for information system need a comprehensive measurement method. How to ensure that the effective operation of IT systems and governance is the main factor to performance measurement based on the level of information management and control. However, many organization managers think investing in information and IT constriction projects is the only way to enhance the competitiveness of the organization and the value of the organization. As a result, information based performance is not a consequence of a post eventual reflection, which is not only relevant to the realization of the functionality of the final system (the number of products and services provided) and the achievement of the results (effectively meet the expected mission objectives), but also includes information in the implementation of the strategy, management control, project management, and comprehensive capacity, which contains operational efficiency, and the ability of sustainable development. ConclusionsIn the external macro-policy guidance and the development of IT itself, driven by the survival and development of the organization for the strategic significance of the development, the value of information on the organization also placed a high position. Although all aspects of the organisation information has achieved remarkable result, but it still face many issues. The huge gap between the actual application of information and the expectations of the organization also prompted people to have to review and evaluate the information performance and value. Informational performance evaluation should be an analytical process that reflects how IT delivers business value to achieve the missions that it given to. The evaluation of information performance is concentrated in two aspects: on the one hand, process the evaluation of the information, and then provide feedback to the organization after receive the result from the evaluation; on the other hand, take a comprehensive evaluation to the effect of information systems. The only way to build a good organization performance evaluation system is to be able to clear the degree of the organization information construction, and clarify the relationship between investment and income to ensure the organization information construction can be sufficient get their own economic benefits. To sum up, the organizational knowledge management has a significant impact on the performance of the organization. Therefore, in order to improve the performance of the organization, it is necessary to build a comprehensive organizational culture and structure.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Essay One: How to solve potential challenges in requirements determination during information systems development (ISD) Essay Two: How to address rapid change and discipline issues within ISD project – A management and technology perspectives Essay Three: How to lead a dispersed ISD teams: role of social and knowledge aspect in the project management Essay OneTopic: How to solve potential challenges in requirements determination during information systems development (ISD)Lecturer’s Name: Yi-Te ChiuDate: 26th November, 2016Word Count: 977IntroductionBusiness analyst is generally a role of or responsible for requirements elicitation within the organization, and they also responsible for understanding the business requirements and provide the necessary recommendations in order to improve organization performance. Because of business analyst are the people who will understand the business problems as well as potential opportunities or challenges within the business requirements, so they can provide the best approach to solve these problems in order to help the organization to achieve their goals. According to Blais (2012), the traditional activities of business analyst played within the organization is includes scope the business system; translate business needs into requirements; translate technical issues into easy understand language to stakeholders; identify, model and document requirements from stakeholders; communication broker within the organization; test and validation the final project; and represent stakeholders. DiscussionSome problems have been identified during the information requirements determination (IRD) processes (see Table 1), one of the problems is constraints problems, which are human cognitive constraints. Browne &amp; Ramesh (2002) indicated that one of cognition problems is it could potentially limit human to parallel process information within the workspace. They also show that the constraints problems conclude cognitive biases in judgment during decision-making and problem-solving process, understand satisfying behaviour, faulty reasoning during information gathering and representation stages, automaticity problem during the information gathering stage, and problems in long-term memory recall. In order to address these difficult problems, some techniques that business analyst could possibly use within the organization, for example, using directed questions to let users focus on the questions in order to provide useful information. According to Browne, Curley &amp; Benson (1997), there only have two question types are either neutral or directed, which neutral questions are no hidden content to provide or suggest the response. On the other hand, directed questions could shape or suggest the response. The directed questions could solve cognitive biases, satisfying and faulty reasoning problems, because the questions could stimulate user’s memory, and it allow people to ask for clarification or other related information about the key points that people answered previous question, which it could provide more useful information about the cause of a problem. According to another study (Browne &amp; Ramesh, 2002), it could also use a what-if analysis, scenario response, Devil’s advocacy, and flow chart to solve automaticity, faulty reasoning and recall problems. What-if analysis is a brainstorming tool for providing solutions during the information gathering phase, which is used to compare different scenarios and outcomes, and then provide useful information based on the current conditions of the project. Scenario response is another technique used to let users to provide more useful information based on their knowledge. On the other hand, Devil’s advocacy is used to let the user to ask questions about the requirements in order to provide more precise solutions. Moreover, flow chart is used to visualize multiple progresses into a single graph or document, which it could help stakeholders to find which process is unimportant and which process is need improved. Using influence diagram and decision map could also solve potential recall problems in requirements determination. Influence diagram is used to help understand quantitative relationships within the organization and project in math model, and also provide a simple but compact depiction of analysis. In contrast, decision maps provide more details about the potential paths but it too complex to understand. Another problem is variety and complexity of requirements, which could use a what-if analysis, flow chart, evocative knowledge map, affinity diagram and note board to solve such problems. The reason is that there have high variability and complexity could happen during information gathering and representation stages, and will talk about later why we use such techniques. In addition, communication problems are another problem in requirements determination. We could use the flow chart, influence diagram and decision map to solve the problems like we talked before, but we could also use evocative knowledge map, affinity diagram and note board to solve such problems. Evocative knowledge map is a visualize tool for grouping all ideas together to generate a final idea, in this case, it could help to generate the final solution. Similarly with evocative knowledge map, affinity diagram is also used to group ideas together, but affinity diagram will group ideas based on the natural relationship. Note board, which more likes brainstorming tool allows everyone to participate into discussion and provide individual opinions. Moreover, users unwilling to provide requirements are another problem, which includes motivational biases and the Hawthorne effect. Use pre-elicitation conditioning could possible eliminate the problems that unwillingness users to provide requirements, which the strategy of using pre-elicitation conditioning is explain elicited information will be used and benefit to the project and people, and business analyst should assume people will keep confidential during elicitation process. Finally, requirements rapidly changed during the development process is also another problem that business analyst need to face. Markus &amp; Mao (2004) shows that changes in the organization could potentially cause emergent interaction problems, and changes might also include IT infrastructure, business rules, and the business process, which may cause more serious problem compared to changes in project requirements. In order to achieve high quality product, some changes are necessary to the organization, but changes must be made before simulation (simulate potential risks). Change requirements is part of variety and complexity of requirements problem, and it could use the same techniques to solve, but for change requirement is could also use influence diagram and decision map to decide whether the changes is necessary or not, and what potential risks could bring to the organization and project. Table 1: Potential solutions for requirements determination problems ConclusionsOverall, this paper identified five general difficulties within the requirements determination during information systems development process, and we introduced eleven technique tools to address different problems in order to improve the requirements determination process and produce the better final product without causing any issues.

Essay TwoTopic: How to address rapid change and discipline issues within ISD project – A management and technology perspectivesLecturer’s Name: Yi-Te ChiuDate: 26th November, 2016Word Count: 958IntroductionWhen the organization or project team introduced changes to project development process, that changes usually needs to address effectively on both the management and technology side. The management side focus ensure the change is well managed and organized, which in case potential risk happened during the development process. And also, the technology side focus ensures the change is well designed and developed during the development process, and the final product is delivered effectively at the end. The disciplines of change management are through the execution of the project, which is necessary to implement the project management before the changes. DiscussionNelson (2007) indicated that there have four classic mistakes could lead to project failure – people, process, product, and technology. Project process is extremely important to project performance, which includes both management processes and technical methodologies that will be used in project development process. Management perspectiveThere is no doubt that project performance is related to how team leader or project manager to manage the team, which the final consequence of the way of managing the team is project performance. Aladwani (2002) shows that the outcomes of information systems projects are combined with project task, psychological and organizational outcomes, which refer to how management could help project team to achieve the goals. Especially, project management plays a significant role within the project development process. One study (Aladwani, 2002) suggest that individual people should have following skills based on the theory of build effective management: (1) technical skill, which including understanding of technical standards, basic software development, and configuration management; (2) administrative skill, which including time management and ability of provide useful project evaluation reviews; and (3) business skills, which including basic knowledge how to manage business processes, practices and procedures. And also, the diversity of working experiences and education backgrounds should be also considered when people join the project development team. Technology perspectiveGemino, Reich &amp; Sauer (2007) indicated that using information technology project performance (TMPP) model could provide better understanding of some risk factors could potential influence the project performance, and the model through three aspects to provide the basic view of factors could influence performance – risk factors, project management practices, and project performance components. The study shows that the potential risks are related to project size and technical complexity, which it will influence the project process performance. For example, large and complex project could potentially have a large number of changes during the development process in order to reach the goals. And also, if project has a very large number of changes exists, it normally has poor performance, like budget and schedule. On the other hand, knowledge resources are also related to the management process, which it directly related to the final product performance. In other words, there exists a direct relationship between organizational support (resources and knowledge) and project performance. As a result, project management is very important to project development team, which it could impact the how the project processed and how to implement the best practices to the project development team. In addition, Nelson (2007) shows that the way of use or misuse of technology could potentially cause the ultimate project failure. The study suggested that project managers or team leaders should carefully choose the technology that they want to use in the project and try to eliminate the previous mistakes that made before, and also they should try to gain the better understanding of how technology could impact the project performance and avoid using the same technologies in the future. One research study (Nelson, 2007) suggests some best practices in order to avoid these mistakes that we mentioned before. “(1) Avoiding poor estimating and/or scheduling; (2) Avoiding ineffective stakeholder management; (3) Avoiding insufficient risk management; (4) Avoiding insufficient planning; (5) Avoiding short-changing quality assurance; (6) Avoiding weak personnel and/or team issues; and (7) Avoiding insufficient project sponsorship” (pp. 73-76). Moreover, Malhotra, Majchrzak &amp; Rosen (2007) indicated that how information technology used within a virtual team is extremely important to virtual leaders. The study introduced six ways could establish a successful virtual teams by using ICTs: (1) the leaders should build and maintain trust by using communication technology; (2) the leaders should make sure their team members understand diversity between members; (3) the leaders should know how to manage virtual work-cycle, especially, they should know how to using communication technology to manage the virtual meeting; (4) the leaders should know how to using technology to monitor the team process/performance; (5) the leaders should also make his/her team and team members are visible to outside society; and (6) the leaders should also make sure every individual gain some benefits from virtual teams work. Zigurs &amp; Munkvold (2014) also shows that there has different collaboration technologies used within the team based on its functions, such as: Communication technologies – using e-mail or instant message to communicate with team members; Information sharing technologies – using document management system to manage shared content across the internet; Process support technologies – like group support system (GSS) to enhance the communication and decision-making of teams. Coordination technologies – using workflow management system (WMS) to coordinate the information exchange between the work and team members during the workflow execution; Integrated technologies across functional categories – using collaboration product suit (like Google Doc) to enhance corporate communication and information that need to be shared. ConclusionsOverall, by looking at organizational change or projective change, considering both management and technology could possibly make sure any changes applied to whether organization or project could properly address the potential issues, which it might cause potential project failure. In other words, changes in organization always affect people, which also influence the way of management, therefore it is crucial to manage changes properly and avoid risks in the future development process.

Essay ThreeTopic: How to lead a dispersed ISD teams: role of social and knowledge aspect in the project managementLecturer’s Name: Yi-Te ChiuDate: 26th November, 2016Word Count: 958IntroductionThe well-known example of dispersed ISD teams is a virtual team, which it designed to group geographically or time dispersed peoples to work together in order to achieve one or more organizational goals by using information communication technologies. However, the problem is that the role of social and knowledge could dramatically impact the final project result or performance. Team leaders or project managers should try to identify the problems and then apply strategies to the teams in order to build an effective dispersed ISD teams. DiscussionWe team leaders or project managers create a dispersed ISD team, they should consider both social and knowledge aspect before project development. Social aspectGorla &amp; Lam (2004) shows that Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) suggested there have four dimensions within the team: social interaction, information gathering, decision-making, and the way of deal with the external world. For social interaction, there have two types of people within the team – extrovert and introvert. More specifically, extrovert people are more sociable, and they prefer to work with others, on the other hand, introvert people is more prefer to work alone and they are less interaction with other peoples. For example, programmer personality within the team was strongly related to team performance, the study shows extrovert programmer is performed better results than introvert programmer. The reason is that programmers should interact with project managers and designers in order to ensure that the project is “on the track” whether the team is small or big. For small team, programmer is more important, because they usually also act like system analyst, which they are required to interact with other departments. As a result, project manager or the organization should carefully select their team members based on their personnel in social-interaction dimensions. In addition, Ting-Peng Liang, Jiang, Klein &amp; Liu (2010) suggested that people with diverse background is benefit for project development, but the main concern is different social interaction, which it could leader to how process and technology used within the project development team. The study also suggested that social category diversity should consider when selecting team and team members, such as age, status, and sex. On the other hand, Perry-Smith &amp; Shalley (2003) shows that there have been the relationship between social network concepts (both static and dynamic aspect) and individual creativity, which include two important social factors – interpersonal communication and interpersonal interaction. The research study is shown that ideas or information generated during communication could enhance individual or group creativity. Moreover, Teh, Baniassad, Van Rooy &amp; Boughton (2012) argued that group norms should establish before create a team, especially, dispersed team must establish a group norm before project development. The group norms like codes of conduct, which every team members should accepted before join the team, because it is “regulate the member’s behaviours, thoughts, and personality traits, and ultimately determine group communication, creativity, and productivity” (p. 53). And also, the study suggests the team should develop a task-appropriate norms, which it can help the team member more focus on the project rather than other external factors (like the use of technology). Knowledge aspectMajchrzak, More &amp; Faraj (2012) indicated that different knowledge background could lead to knowledge integration difficulty, which it could lead to poor project performance even possible project failure. The reason is that the process of knowledge integration is usually involves knowledge transfer from one to other, which require team members to be able to transfer their existing knowledge to new knowledge area. The example of cross-functional team is showing that how important of ability of knowledge integration could help problem solving and identify potential risks. Five practices was identified to transcend knowledge differences: “(1) voicing fragments; (2) cocreating the scaffold; (3) dialoguing around the scaffold; (4) moving the scaffold aside; and (5) sustaining engagement” (p. 958). Moreover, Kraut, Streeter &amp; Cohen (1995) shows that a large project has a higher success rate compared with small projects, because large projects often have rich knowledge of both the application domain and the software domain, which it can help guides and coordinated the software project. In addition, Strode, Huff, Hope &amp; Link (2012) shows that coordination is the way of manage “sharing, integrating, creating, transforming, and transferring knowledge” (p. 1224), which knowledge is important to coordination within the team. On the other hand, Sharp, Baddoo, Beecham, Hall &amp; Robinson (2009) shows that individual performance was combined with individual knowledge and skills to produce useful resources to the whole team, which the knowledge contribute the most part of useful information to the project team. Finally, Cramton (2001) also shows that how to maintain mutual knowledge is the main problem of dispersed team, which five problems was been identified: (1) possible failure to communicate with others and preserve useful information; (2) uneven distribution of information; (3) difficulty understanding information significance; (4) access information with different speed; and (5) difficulty to explain the useful information. ConclusionsIn order to ensure the social and knowledge does not impact the project performance at the end of development. The project managers or the organization should focus on: (1) Identify key stakeholders; (2) Identify who need what knowledge by using what technical tools to implement such knowledge; (3) Identify culture difference between team members;(4) Mange the knowledge transfer; (5) Ensure good communication between teams and team members; (6) Organize knowledge sharing and exchange bases, such as physical documents and electronic files; For social aspect: Team members should be self-motivated; Team members should also be open and honest to other peoples; Team members should have good communication skills; Maintain trust between team members. For knowledge aspect: Team members should be able to properly transfer knowledge to others; Team members should be able to drive effective knowledge sharing; Mange knowledge coordination and integration.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: Role of ICTs in the Organization – the Impact of E-leadership in Theories and PracticesLecturer’s Name: Anne GouldingDate: 3rd November, 2016Word Count: 1611 AbstractE-leadership, also known as virtual leadership within the virtual team, which it has been around for about a decade. How to take advantages of modern technology apply to leadership practices is the critical part of e-leadership performance. This paper will examine the impact of e-leadership in theories and practices within the organization. IntroductionThis seminar paper report will briefly discuss the impact of e-leadership in theories and practices within the organization. The leadership is defined as “An influence process affecting the perception of events by those who follow the leader, the choice of group objectives, the organization chosen to achieve these objectives, maintaining cooperative relationships within the work team, and the involvement of persons from outside the group and the organization, in terms of support and cooperation.” (Leduc, Guilbert &amp; Vallery, 2015). E-leadership, on the other hand, the leadership is perform with electronic way. Several studies (Walvoord et al., 2008; Shrestha, 2015; Dinh et al., 2014; Avolio et al., 2014; Meuser et al., 2016; Celik &amp; Kaygusuz, 2015; ElKhouly et al, 2014; Fan et al., 2014; Chang &amp; Lee, 2013; Nograšek &amp; Vintar, 2014) note that these leadership could divided into three phases to discuss the e-leadership within the team: The theories of e-leadership – different leadership theories could lead to different results; Principles of e-leadership – the leader should following e-leadership principles when they perform leadership practices within the team; Styles and practices of e-leadership – different styles of leadership could lead to different performance of team. DiscussionTheories of e-leadershipMeuser, Gardner, Dinh, Hu, Liden &amp; Lord (2016) indicated that there has six different leadership theories based on reviewed articles, which includes charismatic leadership, transformational leadership, strategic leadership, leadership and diversity, participative/shared leadership, and trait approaches to leadership. In addition, Avolio, Sosik, Kahai &amp; Baker (2014) also indicated that locus and mechanisms are two fundamental aspects of leadership, which helps to identified five types of locus leadership (leader, follower, leader-follower dyad, collective, and context) and four types of mechanisms leadership (traits, behaviours, cognition, and affect). The results shows that the organization should consider implement total leadership system, which the leadership is performed across all possible organization levels based on Advanced Information Technology (AIT). Sahay &amp; Baul (2016) argued that the most important part of leadership theories is quality between leaders and followers, which there have fives skills could make people be a better follower as well as a better leader – awareness, diplomacy, courage, collaboration, and critical thinking. Moreover, Slykhuis &amp; Lee (2016) indicate that the Technological and Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) and the Twenty-first Century Learning Design (21CLD) framework could be used to promote e-leadership within the workshop. TPACK could help leader to teaching content to their team members, where the technical tool could help them teaching. On the other hand, 21CLD could help leader to develop their own teaching style based on provided rubric, which include technical tools and methods that leader want to use during teaching phase. Principles of e-leadershipWhat principles for leaders should followed when perform their leadership within the team? Walvoord, Redden, Elliott &amp; Coovert (2008) developed a “guiding principles for e-leadership communication (GP)”, which includes individual differences, perception of cues, and functions appropriateness. This GP could help leaders to build a better virtual team in order to gain benefits from e-leadership practices. Cowan (2014) also shows that eight e-leadership guiding principles could help further research study, which include (1) e-leadership have to build based on a trusting relationship between team members; (2) virtual team member must have to feel a sense of leadership when leader perform e-leadership within a team; (3) leaders have to have some social-emotional aspects within the team; (4) leaders should promote a “healthy” team based on interaction; (5) leaders should create a communication norms and show their team member how to use it; (6) leaders only using contextual information to communicate with their team members; (7) leaders should using technology tools to solve any possible issues within the virtual team; and (8) leaders must know how to handle cultural issues between team members. Once leaders followed this eight principles, they could build a high performance virtual team. E-leadership styles &amp; practicesFan, Chen, Wang &amp; Chen (2014) also shows that one of disadvantages of virtual team leadership is leader could not see his/her team member body language and their activities. As a result, leader’s motivating language is become a critical part of how to make virtual team effective. Sahay &amp; Baul (2016) shows that virtual leadership is another format of e-leadership, which present a way of how to manage virtual workforce. They also shows that leadership style could seem as a combination of leader’s behaviours, skills and traits, which it is the way when leader communicate with their team members. Chang &amp; Lee (2013) shows that two leadership styles – transformational leadership and transactional leadership, which different leadership style could potentially influence the project performance. The study results shows that the transformational leadership is better than transactional leadership, because transformational leaders are usually discuss with their followers and provide encourage messages for their team members. Sahay &amp; Baul (2016) indicated that two important features of leadership could lead to organization success, which is suitable and accountable. Because the styles of leadership could impact the performance of organization, which means that effective leader could achieve a better results, in other words, it have better performance compared to other non-effective leaders. However, as a leader, how to perform the best leadership in order to achieve the best performance is the main problem of leader want to be solved during the leadership practices. Sahay &amp; Baul (2016) indicated that virtual leader should have following characters to perform as a team leader, such as motivation, coordination, develop team members and future team leaders. Leadership is the most important factor that for the success of organization, which it could identified through several ways of leading types, such as excellence management, spiritual leadership, value leadership, scientific management and trust leadership. There is no doubt that leadership could affect the success of the organization. Shrestha (2015) shows that there have seven styles of leadership (transformational, authentic, participative, strategic, task-oriented, supportive, and situational) could applied to the organization based on the study of Nepal police station. This study shows that Nepal police station is more looking for adopt transformational leadership compared with other styles of leadership, and the reason is because transformational leadership could encourages subordinates to accomplish more difficult goals, solve problems from a new and diverse perspective, and promote employee self-development. In addition, Fan, Chen, Wang &amp; Chen (2014) shows that leader’s motivating language and feedback could help team achieve a better performance, which leader send “direction-giving” e-mail could potential help team member have more creative ideas. Avolio, Sosik, Kahai &amp; Baker (2014) shows that Advanced Information Technology (AIT) could possible transform how leader could organize leadership within the organization by using AIT. They also argued that using Adaptive Structuration Theory (AST) to study Advanced Information Technology (AIT) could possible influence leadership. On the other hand, Adaptive Structuration Theory (AST) was used to study how people using AIT within their workplace. The article founds that a technology combine tools, techniques, and knowledge to perform participation activities within the organization. In addition, such technology could help leader to monitor and control information. On the other hand, Fan, Chen, Wang &amp; Chen (2014) indicated that the performance of virtual team is also affect by how to use collaboration tools, which the factors include what kind of online collaboration tool experience that team member prior have, what kind of types of task, what rewarding system that the team used, and what cultural background that team member have. Avolio, Kahai &amp; Dodge (2001) also shows that virtual team member using Advanced Information Technology (AIT) to communicate each other, and leadership might be shared via AIT. Cowan (2014) indicated that nursing leadership is one of example how e-leadership performed within health care organization. ElKhouly, Ossman, Selim &amp; Zaghloul (2014) shows an example of the Egyptian government performed e-leadership practices across three departments – Information Decision Support Center (IDSC), Ministry of Communication and Information Technology (MCIT) and Information Technology Industry Development Agency (ITIDA). The results shows that technology is play a significant role within the organization, which it could impact how leadership performed. They concluded that in order to perform successful e-leadership practice, leaders must be able to (a) maintain trust between team members by using proper ICT; (b) effectively manage the software project life cycle; (c) effectively manage the virtual team; and (d) make virtual team both visible at inside and outside. Finally, Avolio, Walumbwa &amp; Weber (2009) indicated that the most common problems/challenges happened within the virtual team is when leader distribute work to their team members in different time zones, and when ICT infrastructures fails. They also shows that compared with traditional leadership models, the e-leadership model is build based on non-face-to-face interactions, which technology is become a the most important factor within the e-leadership. The fundamental issues should be addressed how technology could transfer the role of traditional leadership to individual level within the e-leadership, especially, how to address leadership style and culture issues in the organization. ConclusionsOverall, transformational leadership is probably the best style for the virtual leadership practices, because transformational leader will focus on the values, ideals, morals and needs of the followers rather than his/herself, and the most important is this kind of leadership is focus on the innovation process, as a result, it could produce more creative product and have better performance. However, there is no standard or best leadership style could suit all circumstances within the team. To choose the best leadership style is based on the needs and conditions of the organization. RecommendationsFor e-leadership recommendations, the organization or leader should focus on following points: Monitoring current and future market, and they adjust their leadership style; Cooperate with universities (especially business school) to develop new approach to delivery e-leadership; Encourage employers to use e-leadership programme in order to practices their leadership skills.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: Role of ICT in E-government: the Impact of Cloud Computing in Government InstitutionLecturer’s Name: David JohnstoneDate: 19th October, 2016Word Count: 4443 AbstractCloud computing is a rapid technology dominate the current new technology innovation market. The infrastructure of cloud computing is current well-developed based on the technology that we have, however, there still exists potential challenges for the organization and government need to address. In this research report, we will examine three popular cloud computing frameworks – SOA, TOE, and CMMS in order to find the best practices for the government to implement e-government service based on the cloud computing. IntroductionThe terms of cloud computing have been rapid growth in recent years and has been taken the significant change compared with the traditional computational methodologies in individuals, businesses and government area. The most popular definition of cloud computing is defined by NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology): “Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.” (Mell &amp; Grance, 2011). Although the technology of cloud computing domain the individual users and business area, but in government institution they are more tentative than business when deploy cloud computing services. The use of cloud computing is based on the network infrastructure to provide better services and storage resources in an idealized safe Internet environment in order to save potential cost and flexibility to manage the services. On the other hand, it also clouds bring challenges to government when deploy cloud commuting services around the country. The main reason for government carefully choose cloud computing technology is because there have high risks and security issues when using such technology, however, e-voting system is bring a lot of beneficial to government, like cost saving and easy management (Yang &amp; Tate, 2012). In addition, e-government is another format of government management tool to replace the traditional way of managing government services, the definition of e-government could refer to: “The use of information technology to enable and improve the efficiency with which government services are provided to citizens, employees, businesses and agencies.” (Carter &amp; Bélanger, 2005). Alshomrani &amp; Qamar (2013) indicated that the term of e-government was emerged from e-business and e-commerce in the late 1990s, and the government just also wants to implement ICT innovation in the public sector. According to a recent report, there have five characteristics been identified when using cloud computing technology whether in business or government, which includes on-demand self-service, broad network access, resource pooling, rapid elasticity, and measured service (Alshomrani &amp; Qamar, 2013). By using cloud computing technology has several potential benefits, but also might have potential risks or challenges bring to individual, organization or government. In this research report, we will try to identify the impact of cloud computing services in e-government area based on three different frameworks that found in reviewed articles, which includes Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Technology Organization Environment (TOE), and Common Model Management System (CMMS). And also, regarding the adoption of three service models (SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS) for e-government applications. This research report will examine how these three frameworks supplied with three different service models. For example, SaaS refers to Software as a Service, which could be used to deploy collaboration office suits, like share online documents across the departments; PaaS refers to Platform as a Service, which could be used to deploy public sector applications based on the cloud; and IaaS refers to Infrastructure as a Service, which could be used to build a backup system to store government documents (Zwattendorfer, Stranacher, Tauber &amp; Reichstädter, 2013). In addition, we will try to category these three frameworks into four different development models, which include public cloud, private cloud, community cloud and hybrid cloud (Hashemi, Monfaredi &amp; Masdari, 2013). Furthermore, we will attempt to provide some suggestions to eliminate or optimize the weakness of cloud computing, and strengthen the advantages when deploy cloud computing service. Literature ReviewBased on this research study, there have many frameworks or methodologies already proposed or developed to show how cloud computing technology applied to a government institution. However, in this research report, we only focus on three major frameworks which emerge from nine articles that we reviewed recently, which include Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), Technology Organization Environment (TOE), and Common Model Management System (CMMS) (see Appendices A for summary). The main purpose of this literature review is to identify previously proposed or developed frameworks or methodologies used to identify the cloud computing adoption issue within the government, and also examine the IT-related issues within the information systems research area. Method 1: Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)One of the way to achieve Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) in business is using cloud computing service. A recent study (Alshomrani &amp; Qamar, 2013) also demonstrates that the result of using Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is outsourcing business functions to online service platform in this case is cloud computing. They also indicated that five benefits could bring e-government when they using implement SOA service, which includes availability and accessibility, cost savings, efficiency, flexibility, and scalability. On the other hand, they also identified six challenges in e-government cloud computing, like privacy, lack of user control, system failure, security, on demand self-service, and data leakage. The reason for this article is important is because this article provides deep analyse when use Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) in e-government, especially, the analyse focus on public services in efficient and effective areas. Another article provide a different view of using Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) in government, which the article examine the eight principles when apply Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) no matter in which area: standardized service contract, service loose coupling, service abstraction, service reusability, service autonomy, service statelessness, service discoverability, and service composability. Authors also show that there have three technologies are normally used to implement SOA service: web service technology, software components technology, and REST (representational State Transfer) structure technology (Cellary &amp; Strykowski, 2009). This article is important is because it examines implement SOA service could benefit the government in the economic area. Another article also describe how to using SOA service in government, and also it provide real example about using cloud computing by implement SOA service in the USA, China, New Zealand, Australia, and the UK (Ali, Soar &amp; Yong, 2014). This article is important is because it combines the SOA service method into the real world example to show how cloud computing could benefit to government. Method 2: Technology Organization Environment (TOE)According to recent research (Low, Chen &amp; Wu, 2011), Technology Organization Environment (TOE) was designed to analyse the weaknesses points when adopted technological innovation to firm, and the concept of TOE was originally designed to identifies three different groups when analyse IT adoption by organizations – technological, organizational, and environmental. TOE framework also could use to identify five technological characteristics when make an adoption decision, such as relative advantage, complexity, compatibility, and observability. Furthermore, TOE framework also provides a vision how to enhance the development of e-government. This article is important is because it provides a fundamental view about how TOE framework works and how to use such framework to analyse the ICT adoption with government. Another research report (Srivastava &amp; Teo, 2010) also using Technology Organization Environment (TOE) framework to analyse the impact of ICT within e-government and e-business, and also try to analyse the relationship between e-government and e-business, which they could bring economic impact to national wide. The finding shows that the combination of e-government and e-business model could enhance the national economic performance, and they suggest the decision maker considers both impact of e-government and e-business when adopt ICT in such area. In addition, three contextual factors (technological context, organizational context, and environmental context) could influence decision making when the organization try to adopt ICT innovation. This article is significant is because it using TOE framework to both analyse ICT adoption and performance in business and government perspective. Another research study (Pudjianto, Zo, Ciganek &amp; Rho, 2011) provides an example of using TOE framework in the Indonesian government to explain e-government assimilation, and also it tries to explain how to adapt business ICT into a government perspective. The decision making about how to adopt ICT innovation should be based on the technological, organizational, and environmental contexts in order to get the best performance for organization or government. The TOE framework could be useful to identify the external factors of e-government assimilation process. This article is important is because it provides a perfect example about how to adopt e-government in Indonesia whether in central and local governments. Method 3: Common Model Management System (CMMS)A recent study (Prasad, Chaurasia, Singh &amp; Gour, 2010) shows that Common Model Management System (CMMS) framework was able to implement at state police service, which includes three types of nodes – monitoring node, controlling node, and service node. However, the author suggests that the government should implement a CMMS framework instead of SOA framework, because it can more focus on implementation, usability, and infrastructure when implement e-government service. On the other hand, SOA framework is better than CMMS framework in software implementation, because SOA framework is built on peer to peer authorization. This article is important is because it provides a fundamental view about implementation of CMMS framework, and also it compared with SOA framework if implement e-government service. Another research report (Bannister, 2004) shows that implement CMMS framework could impact national economic factor in Ireland, which using CMMS framework at the Department of Agriculture and Food (DAF) under the Irish government could bring hundreds of millions of euro to the government. Most of e-government were focused on web-based public sector services, but this article was focus on other areas, like health and education. Moreover, the CMMS framework also provides benefits to automate area, the example shows that the system could provide a simple one-click function could check about every detail of registered vehicles. This article is important is because it provides a real example how to implement a CMMS framework in real world, and it also examines the e-government could also benefit to health and education sector services. One of research studies (Prasad, Verma &amp; Sharma, 2010) also shows that the CMMS framework is designed to solve the security problem when implement e-government service. According to the article, one prototype implementation called State Police Information Grid (SPIG) based on CMMS framework was present at Indian Police Department Infrastructure, the infrastructure was specially concentrate on control and authority areas. This article is important is because it provides a how to implement a CMMS framework in government in details, and also generate some general issues when implement CMMS framework. MethodBased on the nine articles that we reviewed before, we could see there has three methods that widely used when implement cloud computing based e-government services. The most known framework is called Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), however, Technology Organization Environment (TOE) could also bring benefits to government, except for software implementation. And also, Common Model Management System (CMMS) was widely used at the police station. In this section, we will talk about how these frameworks were implemented at government, and also to see what challenges and benefits could bring to the government. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)According to Alshomrani &amp; Qamar (2013) recent research, the term of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) was first used in e-business and e-commerce area, and as a result of using cloud computing, it could also implement such ICT innovation in government perspective. Cellary &amp; Strykowski (2009) shows that implement SOA framework contains three services in practice: integrated services, mix services, and value-added services. In addition, three technologies are utilized to implement SOA framework, which includes web service technology, software components technology, and REST (Representational State Transfer) technology. Moreover, REST technology is become a popular web technology due to it can be easily to implement. Ali, Soar &amp; Yong (2014) shows that in the USA, there has two website was based on the SOA framework, which Data.gov is for data inquiry service and Apps.gov for federal government portal. Two cloud computing centres was built-in China in order to provide IT support for local organizations, stimulate economic growth, and promote industrial growth. In New Zealand, the Ministry of Commerce was trying to implement cloud computing within the government agencies in order to implement SaaS (Software as a service) in the future. In Australia, the implementation rate was slower than a private company due to consideration of security, privacy and trust issues, however, Australia has made significant process implementation could compute in the government based on KPMG report. In the UK, the UK government implements “G-cloud” and “Digital Britain” strategy in order to improve IT service provided by the government. On the other hand, the problem of e-government is there is lack of IT leadership in the government, and IT leadership is an essential component develop e-government service. The main challenge for the government is how solve security, privacy and trust issues when implement cloud computing based service within the government. Technology Organization Environment (TOE)In order to explore the cloud computing adoption issues, Technology Organization Environment (TOE) could divided into three factors to address the adoption issues, which are technological context, organizational context, and environmental context. According to Low, Chen &amp; Wu (2011) study, the concept of TOE framework was develop by Tornatzky and Fleischer in 1990 in order to analyse IT adoption in organization. Technological ContextThe term of technological context was refers to internal and external technologies suitable to the organization (Low, Chen &amp; Wu, 2011). The problem for implement cloud computing service is the government may need take long time to complete the system because it new technology and they did not have confidence using new technology, especially, for the government perspective. Another issues is that the cloud computing might not compatible with current running system, which it might have adoption issue if the government force to implement it. Srivastava &amp; Teo (2010) shows that using e-government systems could provide an opportunity to connect citizen and business together. Organizational ContextThe term of organizational context was refers to the indexes within the organization, such as size, organization structure, and scope (Low, Chen &amp; Wu, 2011). In this context also apply to government perspective, how to manage the government is the main issue for leader, how to maintain a positive relationship between management support and adoption issue with new technology is the main problem of the government faced right now. In addition, technology infrastructure and IT human resource also could impact the new technology adoption, which technology infrastructure provide cloud computing applications that allow the organization use, and IT human resources provide the required skills and knowledges in order implement cloud computing service. Srivastava &amp; Teo (2010) indicated that the most important factor for organization context is human resources, which could decide whether the system is success or not. Environmental ContextThe term of environment context was refers to industry and government policy (Low, Chen &amp; Wu, 2011). Because high-tech technology rapid changed during past decades, and the organization might hard to implement newest cloud computing technology, which make the decision maker reconsider adopt IT innovation to the firm. Srivastava &amp; Teo (2010) argued that the national environment could both impact the institutional and macro-economic environment when implement cloud computing technology, which it could directly impact the e-government development level. Common Model Management System (CMMS)Bannister (2004) shows that one example using Common Model Management System (CMMS) framework to implement e-government is the Department of Agriculture and Food’s Cattle Movement and Monitoring System implemented by Irish government, which links farms, marts and factories together in order to allow the government certify origin of beef on the market. Prasad, Verma &amp; Sharma (2010) indicated that another example of using CMMS framework is implement State Police Information Grid (SPIG) in Indian Police Department Infrastructure, which it made police station strength their control and authority at local region. However, the problem is that state and central government have different policies to use and apply to local government. Prasad, Chaurasia, Singh &amp; Gour (2010) also shows that CMMS framework have a problem with software implementation compared with SOA framework, which the CMMS framework is lack of peer to peer validation. FindingsAs we reviewed nine articles at previous sections, cloud computing service has rapidly growth at the government. We will talk about (1) how cloud computing service implement within the government, (2) what benefits of implement cloud computing service, and (3) what kind of challenges that the government might be faced, based on the three frameworks that we discussed before. Cloud computing in the governmentAlshomrani &amp; Qamar (2013) indicated that there has two kinds of information or services could delivered by cloud computing service – government to citizen (G2C) and government to businesses (G2B), the reason of the government delivery such information or services via ICT is because it could get better performance of public sector service. Yeh, Zhou, Yu &amp; Wang (2010) shows that the example of the USA and China currently improve their government service by adopted cloud computing service in order to build an e-government service platform. The article shows that the USA currently established two online platforms to perform cloud service to public – data.gov and apps.gov, which both of online platforms offers data inquiry for public and promote cloud computing service to other government departments. China, another example, built two giant cloud computing centre across the country in order to provide IT support for local organization, such as conduct research data process, and simulating economic growth. The article also shows that the benefits of using cloud computing service is could create potential values in government, such as beneficial for serving the public sector, promote cooperation with business, promote the public construction, raise the utilization rate of resource, improve administrative efficiency, potential reduce the government budget, and robustness. Benefits of using cloud computing in the governmentAlshomrani &amp; Qamar (2013) shows that if government invest a lot of money to e-government service, it could potential improve reliability of the government, easy to maintain the public services, make government budget more efficiency, and benefits to other non-functional properties. And also, such cloud computing could benefits for e-governments in several ways, such as availability and accessibility, cost saving, efficiency, flexibility, and scalability. Moreover, Iovan &amp; Daian (2013) shows that the reasons of why the government should implement e-government service to public: Government transparency – all the documents or information is made accessible to the public, which means the public could easily to find the legal records by simply click a button; Financial motivations – implement cloud computing service could potential saving cost, especially, saving the public budget; Information accessing and sharing – pubic could access any legal information or service via e-government service, like law/act documents, paying tax, or paying ticket; Enhance social information analyse – help the government get the data from different sources, for example, e-voting system real-time status; Citizen information consolidation – the government could using e-government service to gather public idea or information, for instance, the government to seek the opinions of the people about the government street transformation plan. Challenges of using cloud computing in the governmentOn the other hand, Alshomrani &amp; Qamar (2013) also shows that implement ICT innovation could also potentially over budget, the demand of information and services increased due to public asked for, and potential challenges for IT technology adoption. Paquette, Jaeger &amp; Wilson (2010) indicated that many risks associated with the implementation and use of cloud computing technology, such as policy changes at data centre agency, dynamic applications implementation difficulty, and dynamic environment security issues. In addition, the key risks has been identified when implement cloud computing service, which includes tangible risks (such as access, availability, infrastructure and integrity), and intangible risks (such as access, reliability, continuous service, and security). More specifically, for tangible risk: Access – the government private data have to be secured, which only allow authenticated used to check; Availability – the government cloud computing service need to 24/7 up time, which no interrupt service condition happened and back-up plan should be have if necessary; Infrastructure – the cloud computing infrastructure should be flexible and scalable, because the demand of cloud computing service will increasing in the future; Integrity – the cloud computing service that the government used should provide accuracy information to public when they inquire. For intangible risks: Access – using or accessing cloud computing service should be easy without any obstruction and interruption through Internet; Reliability – cloud computing service should 100% reliable, because the government have many “mission-critical” application running on the cloud; Continuous service – loss of service could affect the government functions, which it might lead to government loss confidence using cloud computing technology; Security – a big concern when the government implement cloud computing technology, which the government should prevent possible unauthorized access to both code and data. DiscussionThrough several articles that we examined before, we could find that new IT technology, especially, cloud computing service is quickly dominated the business and the government. However, there always have benefits and challenges when chose a certain type of technology implementation to their organization. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) as an example that we talked before was successfully implement within the e-government, and a several studies (Alshomrani &amp; Qamar, 2013; Cellary &amp; Strykowski, 2009; Ali, Soar &amp; Yong, 2014) shows that SOA framework is using Cloud Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) model to delivery cloud computing service to public sector, which it made organization and other government agencies could easily using cloud computing resources, like online storage, process data, and middleware on demand. They also indicated that SOA framework is based on a hybrid model to deploy the cloud infrastructure, which it combined three different deployment models together – private, community, and public model. In other words, private cloud is for the government itself, community cloud is for other government agencies and organization, and public cloud is for citizen or other private companies, for example, Indonesian government successes implemented e-government since 2000. Technology Organization Environment (TOE) is another example of how cloud computing service implements within the e-government. Several studies (Low, Chen &amp; Wu, 2011; Srivastava &amp; Teo, 2010; Pudjianto, Zo, Ciganek &amp; Rho, 2011) shows that adopt a new IT innovation required “advantageous technology portfolio, organisational structure, and environmental strategy” to the organization and government. The government should be aware of adopting new IT technology whether or not suitable for existing functional applications based on three features (technological, organizational, and environmental context, respectively) that could impact cloud computing adoption from TOE framework. The results show that the business and government could successfully implement cloud computing service within their organization when they using TOE framework to analyse the conditions first. On the other hand, Common Model Management System (CMMS) is similar to SOA framework expect SOA is better with software implantation. Recent studies (Bannister, 2004; Prasad, Verma &amp; Sharma, 2010; Prasad, Chaurasia, Singh &amp; Gour, 2010) shows that Irish government implement e-government service is based on the CMMS framework, which is successful working as expected, and it make benefits within the European Union under the Common Agricultural Policy. Another example shows that state police services could potentially get benefits from implementing CMMS framework, such as monitoring, controlling, and public service. For example, Indian government implements the State Wide Area Networks (SWAN) across the country, the results as it helps the government to achieve fruitful e-governance. Select the best approach for the governmentAs we discussed three cloud computing frameworks before (SOA, TOE, and CMMS), the question for the government is how to choose the best approach in order to successful implement e-government functions and services. Based on the summary of three frameworks (see Table 1), we could see implement Technology Organization Environment (TOE) is the best approach for the e-government service. The reason is that: Implement TOE framework could improve and increase the provision of government services; Citizen get more power through information accessing and government interaction; Improve government transparency. Eliminate the weakness and strength the advantages of cloud computingEverything have both sides, once the government selected the best approach for implement cloud computing service within the country, the government should consider how to eliminate the weakness of the cloud computing, and also they should consider how to provide advanced cloud computing service based on the current framework. Wyld (2010) indicated that possible weakness of using cloud computing service includes abuse of the cloud, data breach, denial of service attack, possible data loss, and spiteful activities. As we can see, security is the main concern of using cloud computing service, the possible solution for solve such issues includes: Using higher version of encryption keys, like 256-bits instead of 128-bits used right now; Build a better firewall to prevent possible hacker attack; Separate workplace and private data in order to prevent possible Denial of Service (DoS) or Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack from outsiders; Encrypt the whole data, not just the access key; One of benefit using cloud computing service is allow user access the most current technologies without consider the software and hardware updates, which it could potential save a large amount of government budget. Another benefits of using cloud computing services is that give the government ability to communicate and share more easily with others compared with transitional method, which make collaboration more efficiency. ConclusionsOverall, there have great potential that cloud computing could serve as a general service utility and it have a great opportunity to become a next generation of government form. However, this is a long way for new ICT technology adoption within the e-government service before it becomes utility which suitable for every perspectives. The frameworks that we discussed before shows that the infrastructure of cloud computing is not the major issue of new IT adoption, on the other hand, software is the main issue that both developers and organizations should be addressed in the future. Nevertheless, cloud computing still need to further development to make sure the challenges of the government current faced has been solved. However, there is no doubt that the government or other organizations could continually benefit from the cloud technology in the next decades. ReferencesAlshomrani, S., &amp; Qamar, S. (2013).

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: Why are retail companies so interested in using social media for marketing purposes, and why are they finding it so difficult? Explain your answer.Lecturer’s Name: David JohnstoneDate: 18th September, 2016Word Count: 1600 AbstractSocial media changed human social life over past years, the way of communication has evolved into a revolutionary age, through paper to voice and to Internet. This essay intends to discuss the reason of why modern retail companies start consider using social media as one of marketing tool, and address some issues when company try to implement it with three different aspects - advanced targeting options, improved conversion, and increased engagement. IntroductionNowadays, the term of social media to become a rapid growth popular word in our daily life, and it probably dominate the most our time. But, what exactly the social media means? Kaplan &amp; Haenlein (2010) indicated that social media contains a collection of “internet-based applications”, which allow online users to publish and exchange what they created or shared content within the online community [2]. Because of social media became a popular tool which allows retail company to deploy their business market, however, they find that it is difficult to implement and deployment properly based on the market demand. This essay will address this problem based on following three aspects to analysis why retail company interested in using social media as a tool to extend their market, and the reason of why they find difficult to implement it: social media could provide advanced targeting options for retail company to extend market, improved conversion tracking based on the performance of social media, and increased engagement with valuable consumer through social media exposure. DiscussionSocial media marketing is considered as the next big thing by companies to exploit the market and build the brand across the market. The first reason of why retail companies want to use social media as one of the marketing tool is that social media could expand virtual world potential consumers caused by social media provide more targeting options. Johnstone (2016) mentioned that there have six different types of social media, which consist of social networks, bookmarking sites, social news, media sharing, microblogging, and blogs &amp; forums [1]. Each type of social media is targeting different group of users, for example, Facebook is an online community platform to provide connection services based on real world user profiles. Kaplan &amp; Haenlein (2010) shows that a group of end-user could achieve a better outcome than individual end-user [2]. Kietzmann, Silvestre, McCarthy &amp; Pitt (2012) also shows that the difference between group and individual is that behavior is different, which means that individual may contain a number of identities, but the group only has one identity [3]. In other words, the impact of group people has more power than individual people. For example, if one person liked a public page on Facebook, his/her friends will get notified the post, because the post is either open to the public or friends. Furthermore, social media platform provides an opportunity that allows the firm gets into virtual marketing with low cost or even free. Tate, Gao, Zhang, &amp; Johnstone (2016) indicated that social media platform seen as “promising marketing channel” with minimal cost for small business [4]. In addition, social media could also help the company to improve version tracking based on social media performance. Kaplan &amp; Haenlein (2010) indicated that social networking sites is an online application that allow user to create their profiles, which contains their personal information, like photos, videos, audios, and notes, and also they can invite their friends or families to join with them. They also show that some companies already using social networking as a tool to do some marketing research, so they could find out what consumer would like company to show on the virtual community. However, they also show that because social media is allowing the user to create an anonymous account, so it could destroy company’s reputation within the online community [2]. On the one hand, online user might do not want to share content from strange user or advertisements on their timeline post due to concern about their privacy. Tate, Gao, Zhang, &amp; Johnstone (2016) indicated that why user do not share other people’s content (like click “like” button or repost the original content) is because they do not want to disclose their personal information [4]. On the other hand, people want to share some advertisement information because they want to get a discount price or coupon code from the company that they want to purchase. Tate, Gao, Zhang, &amp; Johnstone (2016) also shows that the motivations of users want to interact with the company on social media is because buying products, receive discount information, present their opinions and get services from company [4]. According to Kietzmann, Silvestre, McCarthy &amp; Pitt (2012) recent research, they use honeycomb model to analyze social media with seven constructs, which included identity, presence, relationships, conversations, groups, reputations, and sharing. From identity of social media perspective, three problems has been found within social media, which is there might have multiple identifies for one single person on single social media platform, and also the information provide on non-anonymous or anonymous social media platform might not accuracy and real. The importance of user provides accurate information is that the company could focus on the group that they want to sell their product or service, but the inaccurate information might provide misleading market strategy. From a relationship perspective, each individual has their own social networks, which may contain hundreds or thousands connections. The importance of people maintains such relationship is the key to distribute their idea or thoughts, so once company’s advertisement influence he/she, his/her network members might also influence by the same content. From reputation perspective, how good or bad of a company or a product/service is based on the user’s experience, which means that a good reputation can influence potential consumer future action, like make a decision about purchase goods or services. From presence perspective, the company should be aware of user’s availability and engage with them in real time, which means that the company might need to put more effort on social media to keep consumer “online”. From conversation perspective, the company should understand consumer conversation on social media because the sense of their conversation might help make a decision when try a new product or service. From sharing perspective, the motivation of consumer share their ideas or thoughts on social media could help the company to analyze the consumer behavior [3]. Finally, social media could be as a tool to increase engagement rate with valued consumer. According to Kaplan &amp; Haenlein (2010), social media provide a platform with low cost but high efficiency that allow the company directly deal with end-consumer compared with traditional media, and it both good for large firms and middle or small firms, even good for nonprofit organizations and government departments [2]. On the other hand, Tate, Gao, Zhang, &amp; Johnstone (2016) also shows that the problem of across cultural issue within social media might also be a problem when the company decides to get into virtual community [4]. However, Tate, Gao, Zhang, &amp; Johnstone (2016) shows that the content shared on social media might reused by other online users, the benefit is that they can help company to spread their words, but the bad news is that there is no copyright obtained by the content, and user might change the content to provide misleading information [4]. Tate, Gao, Zhang, &amp; Johnstone (2016) argued that consumer use image and symbol to identify the brand in their identity construction [4]. According to Kaplan &amp; Haenlein (2010) recent study, ten advices have been suggested to companies who want to use social media as a marketing tool, there are: (1) choose the right social media platform to play with, but “being active” is the key to success; (2) make own social media platform or buy existing plan or do both is next decision that the company need to decide, make own social media could provide the best practices to consumer, but there is lack of user base, or buy existing plan on existing social media, but the cost might be very high and not suitable for current company; (3) company need to make sure their content is up to date and activated communicate with users across the different platform of social media; (4) integration between social media and traditional media, because consumer consider both media is the same; (5) enable all people can access the social media, because normally company will block corporate computer to access social media; (6) the company need to make sure they actually engage with user on social media to develop a relationship with valuable consumers; (7) the company need to carefully listen what consumer want to hear in order to tell them interesting stories; (8) treat everyone equal and be humble to everyone user, because they are the main user on social media; (9) the company need to avoid use professional content on social media; and (10) be honest to everyone because the company might lose their market if consumer find out they are provide misleading information [2]. ConclusionThe use of social media is to spend less money to gain the better result, and also to provide better service to valued consumer. However, social media might not be the main market that the company should focus on. Tate, Gao, Zhang, &amp; Johnstone (2016) shows that social media is a place for marketing, but not the primary place, because social media is only part of consumer life, and their real life relationship could influence their behaviors on social media [4]. The benefit of using social media as one of social marketing tool is to provide advanced targeting options compared to traditional media. And also, it can improve conversion and increase engagement with consumer based on the function of social media. However, whilst social media is important for the company to expand their market and establish a better relationship with the consumer, evidence suggests that the company should carefully consider social media as their primary marketing place. In this way, social media can be seen as having an important combined role in company’s marketing strategy. References[1] Johnstone, D. (2016, August). INFO 402 – Week 6 – Social Media.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: The organization should concerned about both business and technical issues when implementing cloud computing technologyLecturer’s Name: David JohnstoneDate: 14th August, 2016Word Count: 1555 AbstractThis world is now turning into a big village because of the cloud technology is growth so rapidly at recent decades. This essay intends to describe the business and technical issues within the cloud computing technology, and explain why the organization should both concern business and technical issues when they implement cloud service in three different areas – ease of use, cloud performance, and security and privacy. IntroductionThe concept of cloud computing was first introduced around 1950s, and it became a disruptive technology to take a place in new information technology service compared with the traditional computational methodologies before the term of cloud innovated (Johnstone, 2016) [1]. Although cloud computing should be concerned in the business perspective, it also widened the gap between technical and industrial aspect, which it can lead to serious issues. There are three immediate motivations might impact the organization to choose cloud computing technology whether or not in their business long-term planning when they consider about both business and technical issues, which include the organization deploy the cloud computing is based on ease of use, the organization should consider cloud performance when they choose cloud service provider, and the cloud computing platform should consider security and privacy issue. This essay will discuss these issues to explain the relationship between the organization and cloud computing in business and technical perspectives. DiscussionThe terminology of technical requirement is concerned both hardware and software, which it will further address these issues within following discussion. First of all, when the organization deploy the cloud computing service should base on the term of ease of use, which means that the organization should consider the form of accessibility and availability of the cloud computing service. Gupta, Seetharaman &amp; Raj (2013) indicated that software could help small and medium business (SMBs) to manage their e-mail service, software deployment and other related assets services. The example of Dell cloud service provides such service to SMBs, which they provide customized service to SMBs to help the organization to deploy their business system [2]. The business suit software or commercial software specially designed or customized for business could help quickly deploy their service without providing extra cost or support, because they outsourced such service to a third party service provider. For example, Victoria University of Wellington use Microsoft Office 365 to deploy the software and service to both students and staffs, which include e-mail management software, word and data processing software, cloud storage service and online video conferencing software (http://www.victoria.ac.nz/its/student-services/software). Both students and staffs could use their e-mail account to download and use such services that described before from their e-mail web service interface. As a result, university could quickly help student to install the office software on their personal computer without provide extra cost to licencing software, because university use Microsoft cloud service to manage their service with student e-mail account, which every student assigned with a unique school e-mail account once they fully enrolled at university. In addition, Yang &amp; Tate (2012) shows that one of cloud computing services provide to the customer is IaaS, also known as Infrastructure-as-a-service, which such cloud infrastructure gives a full or limited control to user, like operating system and applications [3]. Gupta, Seetharaman &amp; Raj (2013) also shows that user can simply use their login authentication information to access clod service from anywhere on any device [2]. For instance, Amazon Elastic Cloud Computing (EC2) and Simple Storage Service (S3) cloud services are available to the public user, and they provide a remote interface to help the user to set up their personal server with just couple of clicks. Furthermore, cloud service also helps the organization deploy their service or system with minimum financial support and reduce cost of upgrading hardware device. According to Gupta, Seetharaman &amp; Raj (2013), when small and medium enterprises (SMEs) moved from PC-based infrastructure to cloud based service, it can avoid cost of sustaining hardware upgrade or even no front-end system capital investment, especially, upgrade hardware components in order to maintain the service and system [2]. Marston, Li, Bandyopadhyay, Zhang &amp; Ghalsasi (2011) also argued that the organization cloud avoids or reduce unnecessary hardware expense to deploy the service, so they can put these capital investments into their business structure work and put more time on business market [4]. Secondly, the organization should consider the cloud performance based on their enterprise scale when they choose cloud service provider. There has differences between how much money that spend on the cloud infrastructure and service performance that the organization required. Gupta, Seetharaman &amp; Raj (2013) stated that the organization should choose an appropriate cloud service provider based on the demand for service in order to avoid over-budget problem [2]. For example, Amazon allow the user to choose different cloud platform based on machine configuration, storage capacity and network usage. For a large organization, they should choose a better operating system and system layout, larger storage and high bandwidth compared with a small or medium organization. But one benefit for choosing cloud infrastructure is that the scalability of cloud service, which means the organization can change their cloud service anytime based on their demand. Furthermore, a recent study shows that cloud performance is one of major technological issue in related cloud computing research articles, and one of significant reason of user switch to cloud computing is performance improvement that provided by cloud service provider (Yang &amp; Tate, 2012) [3]. As an example, one of cloud computing services is Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), which enable software developers to work collaborate with others during the process of information system development. Additionally, Marston, Li, Bandyopadhyay, Zhang &amp; Ghalsasi (2011) shows that the organization should also decide how to adopt cloud service into their business perspective, especially, how technology adopted and implemented within the organization. They also indicated that if the organization already have in-house applications, they should find the best approach to integrate their in-house applications with cloud applications [4]. For example, Microsoft use OneDrive to allow user access their business application both remotely and locally, and Apple also launched a similar cloud service called iCloud that also allow users working on their documents within different platform. Finally, the organization or cloud service provider should also consider security and privacy when deploy the service or system. The biggest concern around cloud computing is security and privacy issues, which it determines the willingness of people chooses cloud service. Gupta, Seetharaman &amp; Raj (2013) introduced four different cloud deployment models based on the demand of cloud service, which included public cloud, private cloud, community cloud and hybrid cloud [2]. One example shows that the US government use two cloud models to implement their service public users, which private cloud for isolating the internal environment from the external public world, and community cloud is used to provide service to public users. According to Yang &amp; Tate (2012) study, another technological issue that the organization concerned is security, which involved in two different areas – data security and network security, like data encryption, software authorization, and Dos attack detection and defence [3]. The security issue is more concerned about software problem, like what network protocol used to protect plain-text data, and what kind of firewall to protect outside attack. For example, Victoria University of Wellington offers staff VPN (Virtual Private Network) service that allows them to safely access resources from their off-campus personal computer (http://www.victoria.ac.nz/its/staff-services/self-help/faq-vpn). And also, such myVic and Blackboard online system is performed with https protocol, which it can provide a secure communication over the Internet. In addition, a recent study shows that one of threat of cloud computing is the organization might have a lack of control of their operation, which bring the concern of security issue because there has no or lack of industry standards for cloud computing (Marston, Li, Bandyopadhyay, Zhang &amp; Ghalsasi, 2011) [4]. Yang &amp; Tate (2012) also indicated that privacy issue could address from ethical or legal views, because user will be bound to upload and store their files on remote cloud service, and their business and personal information are managed by third parties, which they could not 100% guaranteed there not data leakage [3]. For this perspective, there have three ways to prevent security problems in cloud computing industry: (1) detect possible intrusions, which provide first line of defence to prevent possible attack by using activity or traffic monitor to block any unusual network traffic, or using log to identify possible intrusions; (2) the second line of defence is using identify management to control user, which it can make sure the data is accessible for certain or assigned users; and (3) the third line of defence is using access control management to authenticate user, for example, the device must be authorized before login, also known as the term of two-factor authentication. ConclusionThere have been many business and technical issues discovered during the process of cloud computing deployment, and there has been difficult to address these issues with either business or technical perspectives. However, three advantages that could help the organization choose cloud computing technology when they want to switch to cloud infrastructure from local application. The challenge is how to identify the specific business and technical issues for their business planning, and how to choose the best clouding solution to meet their business concerns. Following suggestions might help the organization to determine the right cloud computing service: (1) using an appropriate business analysis methodology to identify the requirements and issues that exists within the organization; (2) simulate the cloud service before use or deploy it; and (3) find the best approach to adopted the cloud applications with the local applications. In this way, cloud computing technology could solve the problem of business and technical issues within the organization. References[1] Johnstone, D. (2016, July 26).

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: Cyber-forensics – a developing tool for solving computer crimeLecturer’s Name: David Johnstone &amp; Tony HooperDate: 12th June, 2016Word Count: 3483 AbstractThe world is turning into a big village because the network developed rapidly nowadays, and there is no boarder can isolate the cultures and languages. However, this modern technology brings a huge issue when we deal with the crime, especially, the computer crime across the Internet. The field of cyber forensics has raised due to the growth of computer crime, which involves collecting, reserving, and analysing the digital evidence without destroying the original data and physical devices. Apart from technology issues that we need to deal with, there also have ethical issues we need to resolve during the process of cyber forensics. This essay will discuss the ethical issue when deal with computer crime in four different ways: privacy, ownership and intellectual property rights, issues of data collection, storage and access, and digital evidence accuracy and difficulties. IntroductionComputer crime, or also called cybercrime abound in today’s society, thus computer forensics was developed as an essential tool to investigate many issues that we facing at electronic age. When computer technology dramatically improved nowadays, the society that we lived has benefited a lot from such technology, but the lesson that we learned might be very expensive. Computer crimes become a very serious issue today, and it might cost up to billions of dollars of damage. Especially, the Internet provides a nest of criminal activities, which the problems includes untraceable mark on the Internet, unrecognised identity, and difficult to penetrate. Cyber forensics was introduced to deal with the computer crime problem, which using certain investigation and analysis techniques to collect, reserve, and analyse the evidences that gathered from target computers or other digital devices that is suitable presented as evidence in court (Rouse, 2013). Computer systems or other digital devices often store valuable data and personal confidential information that could help investigator to identify potential evidences in order to resolve the crime. Digital evidence is the term that used to deal with any data or information that found at crime scene, and it is difficult to collecting and processing the digital evidence before present to court. The process of computer forensics involved eight steps to retrieve digital evidences, which included secure suspect computer, collect every files on that computer, recover any deleted files, reveal all hidden files, decrypted all encrypted files, analyse all the files, validate files that could be evidence, and finally present in court (Strickland, 2008). However, the legal and ethical issues that often come with privacy issues, ownership and intellectual property rights, data collection, storage and access issues, and digital evidence accuracy and difficulties during the process of computer forensics. DiscussionPrivacyPrivacy issues were concerned when police using a certain tool collect data from digital device during the process of computer forensics, because the file not only contains the evidences, but also it might contain other confidential information. Caloyannides &amp; Ebrary (2004) showed that the file that stored on computer is contained “data about the data”, like the date of this file created, when it was modified, who using it, and what software did use. There has a chance that such information might disclosure under this circumstance. Ntantogian, Apostolopoulos, Marinakis &amp; Xenakis (2014) recent study showed that the credentials information could recovered from the volatile memory of Android devices by using forensics software, which means people who have knowledges about computer software and Android system could retrieve confidential information from any Android devices. They also demonstrates the vulnerable has been found at most of Android applications, even the online banking application has less security settings. According to this research, the vulnerable of Android system could help police to retrieve the data from the mobile device, but it also considers that other people’s confidential information might disclose if criminal using second hand mobile devices. A recent news about privacy on mobile device is that San Bernardino shooting in Southern California in 2nd December, 2015, a suspect left an iPhone 5C at scene but it locked with password, and then FBI ask Apple to unlock the device because after 10 trials the information stored at that device will be completely wiped, but Apple refuse to unlock the device due to concerned about users’ privacy (http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/17/apple-ordered-to-hack-iphone-of-san-bernardino-shooter-for-fbi). This case showed that mobile devices could contain a massive data about user, which includes personal information, social media account, and bank account. When police or federal government try to use computer forensics tool to collect data from a mobile device, the user’s privacy should be considered if sensitive data might impact somebody else. According to Brungs &amp; Jamieson (2005), the law called Telecommunications Act 1979 is published due to protect the data during the transmissions in Australia. However, the problem is that the law is only applied to if the person or organisation intercept the data during the transmission and the data for transmission. They noted that the stored data might not protect the law due to the Telecommunications Act 1979 did not examine it clearly in detailed (Brungs &amp; Jamieson, 2005, p. 60). And also, there might have multi-jurisdictional in Australia, which means that different law is applied to different states or federal government. If the crime is committed within the state, the state law will apply to, otherwise, the federal law will apply to if the crime is across the state. Edward Snowden, who is a former NSA employee just leaked a document about the NSA tapping undersea fibre cable for surveillance and collects data in order to prevent terrorist attacks (http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-23123964). This case showed that every information might collect by the government in order to provide useful information when doing computer forensics, however, people won’t know about what information that they collect and how can they use about such information. Another law called the Electronic Communications Privacy Act 1986, also known as ECPA in USA, which is focus on deal with the digital files that transmit through network (https://it.ojp.gov/privacyliberty/authorities/statutes/1285). However, another law called the USA PATRIOT Act 2001, which stands for “Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act 2001”. This law is gives the government right to monitoring or interception telephone communications between terrorists (https://it.ojp.gov/PrivacyLiberty/authorities/statutes/1281). Another privacy is the Internet browser cookies used to identify content of website. Rogers, Goldman, Mislan, Wedge &amp; Debrota (2006) argued that the cookies that stored at computer can be used to identify the URL of the website, dates and times usually stored within the cookies, and it might help police to create an investigative timelines. In addition, temporary cache files could also help investigation, the cache files is stored a couple of website content usually is pictures, but it not the whole history of internet browser, because the cache will be clear when it reach to a default size (http://searchstorage.techtarget.com/definition/cache). The problem is that cookies or cache might disclosure user’s personal information, because cookies also store personal information and track user behaviour. When police perform computer forensic, the cookie might help to create a criminal timeline, but it might also disclosure user other confidential information which is not related to the crime. Ownership and intellectual property rightsWhen police attempt to investigate a certain file, they should check ownership of such objects in order to measure the evidentiary value. Rogers, Goldman, Mislan, Wedge &amp; Debrota (2006) showed that the ownership and security properties of files is not available in FAT file system, and it also not available in Windows XP operating system, they showed that only NTFS file system used above Windows XP can be retrieve the ownership and permission information, which the information is useful to determine the ownership of file and administrator user. When we talked about ownership, we often attempt to relate it to the intellectual property rights. The tools of computer forensic used during investigation often need to recover the file from computer system in order to identify the owner, thus police could measure that the file is whether useful or not. Kessler (2004) revealed that the technology of steganography provide some important evidence when the ownership of file could not identified clearly, he showed that original author could retrieve a hidden message (also known as digital watermark) from a file could prove that the file is belong to the right owner. The digital watermark is like the “data about the data” that we talked about before, the information that associated with the file could help an investigator to examine the owner of the file. On the other hand, Sommer (1998) indicated that the patterns of ownership are changed since all physical document transferred to digital form, the reason is because the computer evidence could modify by criminal purpose, thus the digital evidence could not 100% trusted. There has four ways to change file properties that could make such file useless either in Windows and MAC operating system, such as using details pane in the Windows operating system, or using the Finder could change file permission. The website also list a tool called “BulkFileChanger” that can modify the file attribute, like the created time, modified time and accessed time (http://www.wikihow.com/Change-File-Properties). Office of Legal education Executive Office for United Stated Attorneys (2009) stated that criminal evidence might contain evidence of ownership, and also, the intellectual property of evidence should be considered as part of government’s property. Casey (2002) showed that the most sufficient way to investigate intellectual property theft is through analyse the crime data that transfer between the communication, and key word search is necessary. He also examined that the tool used to investigate this criminal case should be had clearly detailed, because the detailed evidence should meaningful for the investigator. However, the problem often come with if the intellectual property could not determine by the computer forensic tool, Walden (2007) showed that the intellectual property is hardly defined by computer technology, because there might have multiple resources claimed that the file is belong to them, which it will cause misusing or misleading the criminal case to find out the real criminal. On the other hand, Buchholz &amp; Spafford (2004) showed that the metadata that stored on existing system could help to further investigate the criminal case, because the metadata is usually record on non-volatile storage, which means the content of metadata could not change unless the whole system is completely wiped by professional. They also indicated that the quality of the data determine the how to solve the criminal case, especially, the timestamps are considered as a high value evidence, because it can help the investigator to reconstruction the whole file operation ordered by the time. However, misleading information provides to investigator, because the system can be modified by unauthorised person if they gain super-user (or root) permission, like hackers. Based on the ownership and intellectual property rights issues that still exist in the computer forensics, the investigator should develop a new strategy to address such problems. Issues of data collection, storage and accessMarcella &amp; Greenfield (2002) emphasises one of useful process is create a timeline of criminal activities based on the information that collected from computer system or others, and also the evidence should be secure at safe place in order to prevent unauthorised person to access it. They also showed that the importance of creating a profile based on the evidential record, especially, using log files to gain some definite information, because the log file will record any activities did on the system. However, enable log file function that required to monitor the system, which it might not be legal in certain countries. Kruse &amp; Heiser (2001) argued that the investigator should not directly check the original data, because the data might be gone due to some circumstance, the example showed that if the evidence stored at RAM (Random Access Memory) of computer, there will be high chance lose data if shut down the computer before capture all the data. As a result, how to collect the data is tricky when we deal with the digital evidence. In addition, Casey (2002) showed that there has a basic requirement that every investigator must to meet, like evidence preservation, temporal analysis, and evidence recovery. Every evidence must be collected with data integrity or structural integrity, which means the evidence must be collected without any modifications. Moreover, evidence should collect for professional, and supervised by the related agencies. A recent study (Adelstein et al., 2006) found that digital evidence storage format should be have a standard format, which it should store such evidence into digital files based on the template of format. If there has no such standard guide to correct the current format, the information might not be widely understood by other peoples. The universal format could help investigator quick and easy to locate the file that they want to access. But the problem is how to store those evidence, because it unlike other physical document that we stored at the library, it can be influence by other factors which can destroy it. Marcella &amp; Guillossou (2012) stated that investigator should follow three principles when storing digital evidence: (1) make sure the digital evidence is on the requested list that investigate agency proposed; (2) make sure all the digital evidence stored at an acceptable environment, which provide secure, and not impact by extreme temperature or other natural conditions; and (3) make sure all the digital evidence store at the environment that not affect by magnetic fields, dust, or any other damage could destroy it. Consider the mass of data needs to store, the magnetic hard drive is the main storage media that we used today, and the magnetic component is build-in the hard drive, which is allowing a computer to write or read data from the hard drive. However, outside magnetic fields could easily change the sequence of blocks on the disk or even make it ‘clean’ (http://www.igcseict.info/theory/3/mag/). Marcella &amp; Greenfield (2002) showed that the difficulty of accessing the certain file on the local computer system is the file has password protected. If the file is password protected, necessary password cracking program should help the investigator to identify the password, but it might take a very long time to crack it. However, cloud technology growth rapidly today, which make the suspect files is hard to retrieve the content because it stored on the Internet. Moore (2011) showed that one computer forensic tool called EnCase is used to provide preview of the suspect content on the hard disk without exact the image that stored on the disk, and also it can help investigator save time on review every individual files, because it provide gallery view that allow people to use key word search, and hex view to allow people check hexadecimal data. Casey (2004) stated that “illegal access” might happen during the process of investigation, because sometime investigator needs to access the data without permission, which the case might lead to hacking. He suggests when investigators want to access to a certain resource but it needs password. They need to gain a search warrant to prevent possible hacking issues in the future. Digital evidence accuracy and difficultiesMcneil (2009) indicated that the biggest manner of digital evidence is accuracy and reliability, the example is given to how to record a video as evidence, the Scientific Working Group Digital Evidence (SWGDE), which is an organization under the United States government, they list 12 practices when recording video as digital evidence, there is like recording redundant video, recording video in different files, and using standard video format to encoding videos. He also suggested that the digital evidence should be delivery to court directly via a secure network, or other physical disk like DVD should be used as a delivery method. However, there should have multiple copies of evidence, only copy version of digital evidence should be used, the original copy should keep at a secure place, only present to court if the judge ask to. Moore (2011) stated that in order to keep the digital evidence accuracy, the chain of custody should be followed all the time when investigate the crime, because the digital evidence could be erased or modified if it left as unsupervised. He also examined that the steps need to following when execute the search warrant for the purpose of digital evidence accuracy: (1) remove any suspects from computer or other digital devices; (2) make sure the criminal scene is secured by expert; (3) cutting off any outside resource that might have ability to control the computer or other devices; (4) shut down the computer or other devices; (5) any computers should disassemble into individual component; (6) any other evidence should secured at the scene; (7) transport all the evidence to lab and prepare to analyse. Tripsas &amp; Gavetti (2000) showed that digital evidence has difficulty to collect from rapidly changed technology, and using traditional method to collect evidence might cause troubles to capture the useful data. Shipley &amp; Reeve (2006) indicated that a “running computer” could provide a crucial evidence to court if the investigator could able to access it, for example, data that store at volatile memory. However, such volatile data is stored at RAM (Random Access Memory), because every data stored at RAM is as temporary data storage media, so the data could be replace if the application need to refresh, or the data will be lost if cut off the power supply. The challenge is that how to save or retrieve data from RAM, and keep the data into permanent storage media. Goodison, Davis &amp; Jackson (2015) indicated that the limited number of digital evidences could make the criminal case unsolved, and also some evidence is hard to collect, like some evidence can be accessed from local computer but it stored at remote place, for example, the data collected from social media or online cloud storage. In addition, Mason &amp; George (2011) implies cloud computing technology is made difficult for authorities to access the physical data due to the nature of the remote. And also, cloud technology is encrypted by high level of encryption algorithm, which make the investigator is hard to break into the database, even the service provider was unable to access the data without known password. On the other hand, Kerr (2005) showed that doctrine might also can influence the process of collecting digital evidence during cybercrime investigation. Because based on the doctrine only certain institution could access it, and other organisation does not have permission to access the data. He also examined that three mechanisms could apply to when collecting evidence, these are: collect evidence from the 3rd party, collect evidence from the target, and collect evidence in transit. However, those three mechanisms are difficult apply to the doctrines situation, because the traditional rules might not be suitable for the physical world rules. ConclusionThere have been many ethical issues discovered during the computer forensic process, and the methodology that used during the investigation is difficult to deal with either legal or ethical issues. Digital evidence is one of main data have been collected and analysed during the investigation, the theory of deal with digital evidence is associated with different terminologies on how to develop an effective strategy to deal with privacy issues, ownership and intellectual property rights, data collection, storage and access issues, and digital evidence accuracy and difficulties that still remain at computer forensic. Although computer forensic technology has made some achievement, but there still exist enormous difficulties and challenges. Following suggestions might help development of forensic technology: (1) due to high demand of network usage, and nature of dynamic network change, the evidence need a large capacity storage to store digital evidence, so how to effectively preserve, protect and analyse the evidence is the urgent problem need to solve in the future; (2) the jurisdiction policies or regulations is different between countries, so the design of forensics system should be consider to deal with such problems due to network world is global event; (3) the standardization of collection evidences, technologies, tools, and languages should be meet the global agreement and procedure; and (4) there has difficulty when a large computer fraud case happened, because it usually involved thousands of peoples and computers, how to collecting evidence of crime is very difficult, so the investigation agency should develop an automatic forensic technology system that can monitoring and tracking every suspect activities. Any investigator undertaking the investigation process should be aware of the ethical issues within the criminal case. In particular, it is important to be able to collect, reserve, and analyse the data from a crime scene. As we discussed before, computer forensic is a broad domain, which combines the technology, legal and ethical issues within one case. However, whilst ethical issues are important to the establishment of the relationship with the criminal, which it can help better understand the criminal motive and criminal purpose. In this way, ethical issues in computer forensic can be seen as playing an important role in criminal investigation process. ReferencesAdelstein, F.

    <title><![CDATA[ERP and Change Management at Nestlé Case Study Assignment]]></title>
    <url>%2F2016%2F05%2F02%2Funi9%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: ERP and Change Management at Nestlé Case Study AssignmentDate: 2nd May, 2016Word Count: 1994 What could Nestlé have done better in implementing SAP? Because Nestlé is switching to a new system, and it normally needs to take three to five years to implement as Dunn said (Marchewka, 2015, p.300). In order to match the different databases that Nestlé had before, they need to create a completed new system to deal with purchasing, financials, sales and distribution, accounts payable and receivable within the supply chain. When the project came out, there has been lots of bugs exist within the system. In order to make the new system perfect working across the company, they need to: First of all, extend the length of the project, and make sure there are no bugs or minimum bugs within the new system. According to the story, the project team only took eighteen months to finish the product. As I mentioned before, the new system needs to take at least three to five years to implement. The consequence of this new system is that almost nobody uses it, they familiar with their old system that they used before. Steve Pavlina (2008) stated that one of essential skills for good project management is accurate time estimation. The reason is time estimate drives the final result of the project, and also impacts other peoples. And also, time estimates could help organise and structure the project. For instance, based on the project outcome to give an accurate time estimation in order to let the new system to coordinate the various departments. Secondly, the new system still needs to develop further functions based on the client requirements. According to the story, the purchasing department is using the new system, but they cannot integrate with other departments, like finance and sales department because every department uses their own system. The reason why the new system cannot work as expect is because less communication when promote the new system, and the business requirements is not well defined before trying to replace the old system. Good communication and better teamwork are very important when implement the change management plan, and use the proper tool (like Gantt charts) to monitor the progress is essential. Karlowitsch (2011) indicated that people can immediately see what should have been realized in a certain date and when using Gantt charts, if the project is behind schedule, action can be taken to bring it back on track. Finally, the new system needs to install before implementation, and set up a training team within the company. When the company to carry out the SAP implementation, the new system should install first, which means the new system should consider the requirements and find the best way to fit the old system. The reason is because the customer is familiar with the previous system, and they might refuse to use the new system, especially, the new system come with lots of bugs. The company should also set up a training team to help their staffs learn and familiar with the new system in order to reduce potential mistake in the future work. Based on the recommendations that made before, Nestlé should have a better view of the new system and implement the better consequence. What did it do right? Although the new system needs to redesign, the manager is proposing a good idea to headquarter company. First of all, Dunn proposes a very good idea to reorganise the old system in order to make a uniform standard to all departments within the company. Before Nestlé reorganised, Nestlé was a decentralised company, which their brands operated individually. In other words, each of their brands or sub-companies has their own right to decide on every request. This led to each system used by the sub-company is not the same, or these system cannot cooperate with each other, because their system has own database structure to work with the vendor. The consequence is that the same vendor gives a different price to every sub-company, and they don’t have the standard name of the product. As a result, Dunn suggests designing a new system that every sub-company should to use in order to organise their product with the vendor. When using a common system across the company, it could save potential cost to buy the product from the same vendor, and increase the power of group buying. Secondly, although the entire project need to start over, the team come out with a well-defined plan to let the new project start by hired a change director. The team design a new plan based on the current operating mode of the company to design a proper plan to perfectly fit the system. The manager strengthens the relationship between the project team and the decision-making group. Because many decisions need a full group of people to participation to explore the issue may have, every team member should provide their idea during the discussion in order to make the better final decision. The manager use survey to get better understand if the company switching to a new system, and how they deal with the new system. Using business survey can make a better analytical business decisions. The benefit of using survey within the company is that it can strengthen the relationship between customers. The way to meet the customer satisfaction before publish the product is that using a survey to find out the potential mistakes. And also, business survey can help discover new product or services, because it helps avoid missing out any valuable offerings. It also can evaluate employee satisfaction, which is important in order to business to develop a new product. Because the good relationship between employee and employer can help make a good product. Finally, the final goal of develop a new system to the company is saving money. According to the story, the new system can help a company save around USD$325 million when implement SAP. The new system can also help forecast the future demand by analysing the current production process. Good demand forecasting is an essential technology in order to ensure produce good products. Winegarden (2015) indicated that good demand forecasting could help following the market: (1) matching supply to demand; (2) stimulating the new demand to match the market needs; (3) expending vendor capacity to meet the market demand, and (4) developing an efficient procurement within purchasing department. What would have been the value of having a change management plan from the beginning? The first step when developing a project is defining the project’s goal or measurable organizational value (MOV). In other words, the manager should consider what the real value this new project could provide the company. According to Marchewka (2015), developing a project to fit the company’s vision and mission statements is needed to follow six steps: (1) identify the desired area if impact. In this case, Dunn tries to design a new system to replace all current running system, which it will impact all the departments, because the new system needs to apply to all the departments, like purchasing, financial, and sale department. When change management plan from the beginning, the manager should consider all of those areas will be affected and it might very hard to implement; (2) identify the desired value of the project. The manager should determine what desired value could bring to the company. In this case, the new system could help the company do better, faster and cheaper when operating the different departments if compared with the old system. For example, the new system could increase effectiveness, because the demand forecasting system could help purchasing department to get a better view what the demand looks like in the market. And also, it could help the company quickly response to the market, like growing demand and price changes. In addition, it can help the company reduce cost, USD$325 million could be saved by implementing a new system according to the story; (3) develop an appropriate metric. In order to develop an appropriate metric to a new project, the manager and other stakeholders should agree on a specific target. The agreed metric will provide the desired impact to the company, and it can help evaluating the project is whether successful or not; (4) set a time frame for achieving the MOV. Estimate project finishing time is an important when develop a new system. In this case, the deadline for the new system is eighteen months, which is very short consider the size of the project. If the duration of the project is too short, the final product might contain a lot of bugs and did not meet the client requirements. If it is too long, the cost of the project will increase, and could possibly difficult to fit the current system; (5) verify the MOV. In order to make sure the project is accurate and realistic, which means the project is meeting all the requirements. By achieving this step, it requires close working relationship between project manager and other main stakeholders; (6) summarize the MOV in a statement or a table. The statement or table could provide very useful information to project team and all project stakeholders. In this case, the project manager should provide information to all stakeholders to indicate the potential cost could be saving if apply the new system to the company. The primary lesson that Dunn says she gained from this project is “No major software implementation is really about the software. It’s about change management.” Do you address with her statement? Yes, I did. The ERP system could affect everyone in the company, and the major problem is how to implement the change, not the way to develop the new system. Because there is the absence of attention to the employees in this case, which is the manager did not well communicate with their staffs when implement the new system. So when the new system try to apply to the company, no one wants to switch to the new system that they did not familiar with. A planned approach to integrating the change which the formal processes could be impact of the change both on employee and the way they do their jobs. The recent application of techniques is used to acquire acceptance and understanding of the change in order to take advantages of the new functionality. Other lessons also she learned is helping to manage the new system. For instance, get a better plan to determine the project time is could help fit the work into a new system rather than fit it into a predefined schedule. Moreover, she also learned test the integration points during the project development. For example, when the new system implementation, purchasing departments cannot integrate with other departments according to the story. The software process will involve during the integration, because the common database should be made available to every departments, and make sure the data is readable even they use different systems. To change the business process is not simply installing a new system, it more about how to change management, which means the most important is the way to change the business process. The company try to implement the ERP applications in order to help the company to organise and standardise their software application and database across the whole company. However, the ERP application is not the final solution, it only a tool to use to change a business process. The whole business process transition should carry by the business manager, not the IT department itself. The ERP application should install before implement the system, which it no independent process and need to everyone participated in the changes. In order to promote the process change, Dunn hired a change director to help her for the remainder of the project. As a result, Nestlé learned a very important lesson in the hard way, which is changing the business process is not simply installing software, and there have been much more like an enterprise wide rollout across the whole system.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: eXtreme Programming at Sabre Case Study AssignmentDate: 11st April, 2016Word Count: 1966 How should the company introduce XP? More specifically, should the company just jump right into it and attempt to use XP on a large, upcoming project that is mission critical to the company? Or, should it experiment with a smaller, less critical project?eXtreme Programming (XP) is a project development methodology in order to deliver a valuable product to customer within a short time. As we know, XP is based on the Agile process model, which means it is more friendly when use it on a small project. When using XP, it will decompose the entire project into small releases where each release contains one or more functions that required by the customers. The benefits to divide the project into small releases is that the developers can quickly get feedbacks from users and being able to solve the problems at an early stage. The final deliverable project should be able to implement all or most of the functions to the end users. Because each release of the project was designed and tested individually, so project manager can accept any form of changes from customers during the development process. Any changes are obtained from communication with customers, like what features that customers want and what the final project should be looks like, and then signed into user stories. The whole development process could be repeat several times until meet the customer requirements. Clear and strong customer communications required during the development, because the functionality of the project is based on the requirements not in the documentation. On the other hand, it has been proved that XP can be also used directly on a large project. For example, Mitchell, Owen &amp; Warr (2004) indicated that in their technical journal which is a group of ten peoples using XP method within required timeframe could successfully complete the requirements to develop an internal component for WebSphere Application Server, which is one of large IBM products. They also show that the results of the project have fewer bugs than projects using traditional methods. However, not all projects suitable using XP method, the reason is that certain XP practices were not designed for large project, for example, if the large project decomposed into small releases, the number of releases could be extremely huge and hardly maintain. So the entire project may take a long time to complete, and cost could be expensive. The main purpose using XP is qualitative measurement due to the project is focus on time consuming, and needs to quick iterations at each release in order to reach the final target of project. When the team develop a project, they should follow the XP practices, like small releases, simple design and pair programming. Because little or no planning required when developing a project using XP method, so teamwork is highly important for the team. In addition, paralleled programming could reduce the required time, because between two developers who working on the same project, they can fix the bugs immediately during the testing. Although the XP method is not easy to implement, but the end results of using XP can reduce defects in the project. As a result, in order to reduce errors in the project, better use XP method was introduced by small project implemented in advance. Can traditional project management tools such as work breakdown structure (WBS) be used in XP? Work breakdown structure (WBS) can be used in XP. According to Marchewka (2015), the WBS is more focus on developing the project plan rather than change the project structure. So using WBS or other traditional project management tools could help XP achieve better results. Work packages is the name when WBS decompose the project into small pieces, like I mentioned releases in XP before. The function of work package is that to develop a project plan, which is good for time scheduling, budget and process monitoring (Marchewka, 2015). In XP, user functionality is noted in a work package, which the work package contains the terms of functionality what the customers want to have in their project. At the same time, the team should discuss break down the work package into individual task or activity, like what each team member should do. WBS in XP focus on the function to be made before the project initialise, and also make sure the duty of people should be carried out in the project. In addition, WBS in XP also perform an acceptance test which is always updated during the process, rather than planning everything at the beginning of the project. Because WBS provides a bridge between the scope of project and plan, the level of details should support the project, more specifically, the time schedule and budget. Traditional WBS is more like a Waterfall process if compared with our XP-WBS method. When we planning a project, we usually put the plan at the front, and then we can determine who should do what. The XP method is take WBS into every release, so each release know their plan and goal, which is help to achieve the project’s MOV. Because one of the practices of XP is simple design, which means simple code should be implemented during the project, and also as the requirement of work package any issues should be fixed before the milestone of deliverable release. Using WBS in XP is also help reduce the potential risk come with the project, because every task has been levelled in order to make sure the project is deliverable. It can help the logical scheduling, which is make the goals can be complete by step by step. And also, WBS will make sure every team members have communicate with each other, which is can reduce redundant works and possible errors. As a result, work breakdown structure can be used in XP. What methods for estimation would be most appropriate when following an XP approach? eXtreme Programming’s approach is that using smaller release to improve the quality of a large project. In other words, if one small release can reduce the defects in the project, a lot of small releases could reduce more defects in the project. There have two possible budgeting estimation approaches could apply to this case – top-down approach and bottom-up approach. Kim &amp; Park (2006) shows that top-down budgeting was introduced to deal with the fiscal crisis in 1990, and it more efficient to manage government resource compared with bottom-up budgeting. The recent study shows that the advantages when apply top-down approach to the project. First of all, the company or manager control all the budget allocations to different apartment, and they can make sure the project did not over budget. Secondly, manage budget efficiently in order to do not make any damage to company financial system. Thirdly, this approach will allow employee work within the budget and make the best effort (Kramer &amp; Hartmann, 2014). On the other hand, the disadvantages of using top-down approach is that the project may fail if the manger wants to make changes to this project, and it might not attractive because the limit budget. For example, the potential talent programmer might not want to work with company who have a limit budget on their project. In addition, apply bottom-up approach to this project could increase motivation due to the budget is controlled by themselves. And also, the bottom-up approach could help manager or company to get a better understanding on their project due to when they control the budget, they can participate in the working process. Furthermore, it could help get better communication between different departments within the company, because they need to communicate very often in order to eliminate any errors could have within the project. Moreover, the bottom-up approach could also help decrease potential increase funds in the future, because this kind of approach encourages low-lever employees to present their ideas, and the company could wisest uses of those ideas to reduce budget and get better product. Another benefit is that the manager could change the project at early stage, because the budget is control by themselves. However, the disadvantages of using bottom-up approach is that the company might need to change their roll-out system at later, because the contribution of this project is different for different levels people who involved in this project, like people get how many wage is depends on their amount of work. Another drawback to a bottom-up approach is that it might be difficult to list every tasks that need to do at which phase, which means that the planning is not necessary for this kind of approach. As a result, the bottom-up approach is the most appropriate method when following up the XP approach, because it more flexible to manage the project. If the company’s developers have always followed a more traditional approach to IT projects, what impacts might introducing XP have on them? The traditional approach is contains a leader who makes the every decision about the project, including a method that would be used, what plan should be, etc. The person who take all the responsibility of the project, and also he or she will decide jobs for each member of the team. However, without discussion about the role of the job and the scope of the project, the final product could be failing to meet the requirements. So when developers finish the final product, only some functions could be working at certain circumstances, and probably few features that customer satisfied. The worst scenario is start over the whole project from the beginning. The XP method make the developers, managers and customers work together and communicate a lot before start the project, so when developers finally begin to working on the project, they will get a clear picture of what this project looks like, and what customers asking for. Compared with XP approach, developers in traditional approach usually working alone, which brings to a lot of disadvantages, such as need a long time to complete the project, no help from others, constraint in ideas, and may cause too much stress. On the other hand, teamwork could bring a lot advantages to this project, such as increase the work efficiency, higher quality outcomes and improve office relationships. When the project change development method from traditional to XP, developers might think their personality could be lost, because they need to work with others. And also, they might cannot easy to focus what the job they doing, because other members in the group could be conversing the whole ideas. But, well teamwork leader could prevent those problems, respect others ideas could be save a lot of agreements during the discussion. The developers should cooperate in developing a product. It will be difficult work together, but find a right partner could save a lot of time on the development process and save a lot of money. Pair programming could increase productivity due to only small amount of error can be found in the project. Rico (2008) shows that the XP method should obtain some good things from the traditional method, like traditional quality and reliability theory, because it eliminates the possible defects at the early stage of the lifecycle. In order to apply XP method to traditional team, the team leader or manager should consider carefully, because not every project suitable the XP method. Achieving customer requirement could be difficult, but apply the appropriate method to the project could increase the success rate of the project. As we discussed in the previous session, applying XP method to a new project could be difficult, however, making the right decision is very important when decide what method should be applied to the project. Project manager should choose the appropriate method to the project, although XP method could bring a lot of benefits to the product. References:Marchewka, J. (2015).

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: Climate change is driving efforts to reduce planetary greenhouse gas emissions. Finding alternative energy sources is one possible solution. Another involves changing cultures and behaviours. What roles can individuals, societies and governments play in changing the way we use energy so as to reduce greenhouse gas emissions?Lecturer’s Name: Rebecca PriestleyDate: 19th October, 2015Word Count: 1970 Climate change is one of the biggest issues that human beings need to face the human civilization today. And also, it is one the reason human begins to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in recent years. So what is climate change? Human activities like driving cars, burning coals and producing industrial wastes could produce greenhouse gases, and the earth will surround by these gases, so the hot air cannot get out of the earth. In other words, more greenhouse gas that we produced, and our world will become hotter. It is very challenging task for us to stop climate change nowadays. In particular, individual people, community society and the government they all play a significant roles that make an effort to change the current bad situation. The warning of climate change is present in different ways, for example, global warming, El Niuo Southern Oscillation and ice shelves melting in Antarctic. NASA shows that the temperature of the Earth was going up about 1 degree Fahrenheit in the past 100 years (http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what-is-climate-change-k4.html). It seems like is very small change, but it can cause very big effects to our earth. This essay will examine how human beings reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from individual, societies and the government to prevent the climate change causes the big problems in our world. IPCC (2007) noted that the three main greenhouse gases is carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide [1]. Brook (2008) shows that there have ten possible ways that people can reduce their CO2 emissions during their normal life, for example, consuming less red meat, like pork, lamb and beef, because animals like pig, sheep and cattle is the main source of methane emission. And also, people could use public transport instead of driving a private car, because less car means less carbon dioxide emission [2]. Woodcock, et al. (2009) shows that reducing CO2 emissions could do by replacing the private transport both in developed countries and developing countries when they travelling around within the urban area, and it is also benefit to public health. And also, low emissions technology could be reducing the pollution from the private vehicle, which is keeping the road trip safety and provide a better environment [3]. Furthermore, Wilkinson, et al. (2009) indicated that improve energy efficiency and use low emission household cookware could potentially reduce the greenhouse gas emission [4]. Most important thing is reducing the use of energy to improve energy efficiency, like using natural wind rather than using unnecessary ventilation in the house. And also, reduce use of solid fuel when cooking food can also reduce the CO2 emission, and use biomass rather than wood or coal as the source of cooking energy. Bhattacharya &amp; Salam (2002) research shows that the traditional biomass-based stoves could cause a large amount of greenhouse gas emission, although biomass is one of the renewable energy. The principal product of biomass produced is carbon dioxide and water when the combustion is complete, but incomplete combustion produce pollutant gas and greenhouse gas like carbon monoxide and methane. Their research also shows that around 90% of the rural area in developing countries is using biomass energy resources, which is very large part of produce greenhouse gas [5]. If these family switches to low greenhouse gas biomass, the amount of greenhouse gas emission could be potentially rapid decrease. In addition, Amram &amp; Kulatilaka (2009) shows that apply technologies to the life style could reduce the CO2 emission, like change transnational lighting systems to LED system, using solar power to heat the water and using high-efficiency fuel, and this could be reduce around 1.3 gigatons of CO2 every year. And it is the positive return investment during their normal life, which means it does not cost anything, just switch to using new technology products [6]. On the other hand, Friel, et al. (2009) indicated that 80% of agricultural gas emissions are from the livestock sector, which the food system contributes a large percent of greenhouse gas emissions. Around 10~12% of greenhouse gas emissions was from agriculture [7]. Berre, Boussemart, Leleu &amp; Tillard (2013) shows that if the society could balance “farmers’ opportunity cost”, farmers could reduce the CO2 emission, which is reducing the number of livestock that they have [8]. In other words, the market price of livestock products is linked to the cost of pollution and the number of livestock that farmers have. For instance, if the market price is low, the farmer need more livestock to balance the product profit, at the same time, because the number of livestock is increased, the cost of the pollution is increased too. Moreover, Amram &amp; Kulatilaka (2009) shows that implement new technologies to nuclear industry and enhanced oil recovery could also reduce the CO2 emission, and cost of apply such technologies is under $25 per ton of CO2, and it could be reduce annual CO2 emissions by around 0.8 gigatons [6]. For example, according to New Zealand Wind Energy Association, New Zealand currently 70% of electricity was generated from renewable energy, and wind energy is playing an important role in renewable energy. The benefits of using wind energy are that produce much less greenhouse gas if compared with other kinds of energy, like solar or geothermal (http://www.windenergy.org.nz/store/doc/BenefitsofWindFarms.pdf). Greenhouse Gas Working Group (2010) report shows that reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions could through five different ways, which include reduce fossil fuel consumption, improve soil carbon sequestration technology, improve the utilization efficiency of nitrogen fertilizer, improve the efficiency of ruminant digestion, and capture the greenhouse gases from animal wastes [9]. Not agriculture plays an important role in the greenhouse gas emissions, cities also play a significant roles. According to UN-Habitat (2015), cities produces more than 60% of CO2 emissions through human activities, like vehicles and biomass use [10]. Cheeseman (2015) indicated that if cities use non-fossil fuel sources to produce the electricity and encourage people using electric car, and it will reduce the CO2 emission by 80% [11]. However, Harris &amp; Mele (2014) shows that the Chinese government implements the individual emissions Trading (IET) scheme to the individual person, the permits of greenhouse gas emission were allocated to each individual person, and the government set a limit to each person. And also, people could get benefits from the IET scheme. The government will pay a certain amount money to people’s IET card [12]. This is seems like people lived under pressure from the government, however, such policy could be reducing the pollution and push people to replace the low-efficiency equipment with high-efficiency equipment. According to Ministry for the Environment (2015) in New Zealand, the government published the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZ ETS) in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and encourage tree planting. The New Zealand government set a target to reduce 30% of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 compared with 2005 level [13]. The New Zealand government also applies the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) to the market in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions “internationally”, which allow developing countries help other developed countries by investing CDM projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions [14]. Additionally, Haines, et al. (2010) shows that a policy maker should “implement policies to reduce inequities in access to clean energy sources” and encourage people cycling and walking in city centres [15]. In other words, the local government should give equitable treatment with clean energy compared with fossil fuels, and also the government should build more cycling pathway in order to keep people safe when they cycling and walking on the street. For example, Wellington City Council increased their annual budget to $4.3 million specifically for cycling construction in order to improve the cycling routes and keep cycling safer around the city (http://wellington.govt.nz/services/parking-and-roads/cycling/we-support-cycling). Furthermore, Deangelo &amp; Harvey (1998) indicated that all levels of government to cooperate in order to reduce significant greenhouse gas emission. For example, if the federal government wants to implement a carbon tax, it needs municipalities work with the federal government and reduce the barriers [16]. Jamieson, Brasell &amp; Wakelin (2008) also shows that the New Zealand government’s projects to reduce greenhouse gas emission was strongly supported by local industries, especially, the local power companies. In order to encourage local industries to reduce greenhouse gas emission, the government provides subsidies to businesses in the cause of the financial pressure on businesses [17]. In conclusion, the climate change is a complex phenomenon, and it requires human beings to prevent further damage to the earth by human activities. And also, it requires human to change their behaviours, societies to balance the outcome between agricultural and cultural collision, and the government publish useful national policies combine with the international agreements. Of course, human beings have rights to use natural resources in order to meet their consumer demand. However, this kind of right need to base on did not break the basic limit of natural. In fact, by changing or reforming our current technologies, including the production of goods and the provision of the services, it also can reduce the material consumption from human, thereby reducing the interference on our ecosystems and the destruction of the ecological balance. Every country should support the renewable energy development to replace coal, oil and other fossil fuels with wind, solar, geothermal and nuclear to reduce the carbon emissions. People should also take responsibility to reduce the carbon emissions, such as double-sided paper, using energy-saving vehicle, and take more public transport. I believe through our efforts, we can protect our environment in the future. References:[1] Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). (2007). Fourth assessment report: Climate change 2007.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: How has the periodic table of the elements changed over time? Answer with reference to the scientific findings that informed its development. Is the periodic table complete?Lecturer’s Name: Alexander Maxwell, Shaun Hendy &amp; Rebecca PriestleyDate: 8th June, 2015Word Count: 2167 The periodic table is one of the most known chemical icon in scientific society. Before people described the composition of the object, ancient scientist use air, earth, water and fire to identify the object rather than elements or atoms that we usually called today. The modern periodic table hangs on almost every chemical laboratory and lecture theatre around the world. The first original periodic table can be traced back to nearly 200 years ago. The prototype of the modern periodic table was formed by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869, and it ordered by chemical element’s atomic number. But the question is how this periodic table changed as we see today’s look like, and how this periodic table changed science revolution. One interesting fact is that depending on Forbes, Cooper &amp; Mitchell (1953) research, our human body was made by different chemical elements, like water (hydrogen and oxygen), protein (nitrogen), calcium and phosphorus [1]. This essay will examine the history of the periodic table from the 18th Century to the 21st Century. The history of the periodic table could be divided into three period times – illuminative periodic table development, early periodic table development and modern periodic table development. Illuminative periodic table development was contributed by different scientists. According to McKie (1935), the first periodic table was created by Antoine Lavoisier in his book Traité Elémentaire de Chimie in 1789. Nowadays, people called Lavoisier was the “Founder of Modern Chemistry”, which he made the basic language for chemistry development. He was used for classification comparison method confirmed 33 chemical elements, but some are simple substances and chemical compounds when he did classification research. He also explained the cycle of “dust to dust and ashes to ashes” through the experiment during that time [2]. Blumenthal (2013) showed that the most important achievements by Lavoisier are the theoretical development and experimental testing, the “coherent body of theory” was introduced during that time [3]. One of the interesting theories is related to the Aristotle’s Four Elements Theory, which is everything was made up by air, earth, water and fire. According to Blumenthal (2013), Lavoisier’s theory showed that air is not in the four basic elements, but it is the major components of the things, or should call mixture element [3]. Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner, who was a German apothecary, his periodic table included 44 elements organised by their similar valency. According to Kauffman (1999), one of his inventions is called Feuerzeug, in other words, pneumatic gas lighter was invented during his platinum experiment [4]. Robinovich (2008) also showed that he is the first person who found out several groups of three chemical elements due to they have similar “chemical properties”, such as lithium, sodium and potassium could be in the same group. At the meantime, the Law of Triads was introduced, it examined the relationship between the atomic number and atomic weight, and he found that the middle of chemical elements’ weight was roughly the average of the other two elements in these triads [5]. According to Scerri (2011), Leopold Gmelin, who was a German chemist, he also worked with Law of Triads system in 1843, and he further developed the periodic table, which contains 55 chemical elements divided into ten triads. However, Scerri also indicated that Gmelin’s system cannot be identified as a periodic system due to it “does not display the repetition in the properties of the elements.” [6] According to Cassebaum &amp; Kauffman (1971), Jean Baptiste André Dumas, who was a French chemist, one of the major chemical thinkers, he found there has a relationship between atomic weight and groups of metal in 1857, he indicated that atomic weight is equal to the lightest element in the group of mental plus eight times of the natural integers [7]. According to Moore (1918), August Kekulé, who was a German chemist, he showed that different chemical elements combine with different number of atoms, as known as valency today. Kekulé said “It is not only a difference in formulation but an actual fact, that one atom of water contains two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen, and that the quantity of chlorine equivalent to one indivisible atom of oxygen is itself divisible by two, whereas sulphur like oxygen is dibasic so that one atom of sulphur is equivalent to two of chlorine.” in his published work in 1858 [8]. This Kekulé theory is important, because it helped the structure of the periodic table. Scerri (1999) showed that the first person who found the chemical elements is periodicity is French geologist Alexandre-Emile Béguyer de Chancourtois in 1862. Some similar chemical elements can be arranged by their atomic weight become possible, in other words. Chancourtois’s system became the early form of the periodic table, and also his work provides the central idea of Mendeleev’s system later [9]. Early periodic table was developed at the end of 19th Century. Kaji (2003) indicated that in his research paper, Julius Lothar Meyer, who was a German chemist, he wrote a textbook about theoretical chemistry in 1864, his periodic table has 50 chemical elements organised by valency in three different tables, it showed that some chemical elements shared the same valency due to they have similar properties [10]. This form of table is very similar with the Mendeleev’s periodic table, and it was much closer to the modern periodic table design. Emsley (1987) showed that at the same time, William Odling, who was an English chemist published a table with 61 chemical elements organised by their atomic weight in 1864, which is similar to the Mendeleev’s first table, and also he solved the tellurium-iodine problem that Mendeleev does not solved in his first table [11]. Griffith (2008) indicated that William Odling was the first person who put chemical elements into periodic table with reasonable logic thinking, and he also noticed that the similarity between palladium, platinum and ruthenium is that the atomic weight of platinum was almost twice of palladium [12]. John Alexander Reina Newlands, who also is an English chemist, Newlands (1884) showed that the Law of Octaves in his published book, he indicated that the Law of Octaves examine the chemical elements could be arranged by the order of their equivalents because “the eighth element, starting from a given one, is a kind of repetition of the first, like the eighth note of an octave in music.” Newlands’s system showed that if chemical elements are in the same group, they usually in the same horizontal line [13]. Taylor (1949) indicated that as a pioneering of chemistry, the Law of Octaves preceded Mendeleev and Meyer ideas by around five years [14]. Kauffman (1969) showed that a Danish chemist Gustavus Detlef Hinrichs released a spiral periodic table ordered by their atomic weight and chemical similarities in 1867. Kauffman (as cited in Quam &amp; Quam, 1965) indicated that Hinrichs’s system “may very well be considered the first of the spiral systems of classification in much the same way that we think of the tellurie screw of de Chancourtois as the first of the helical systems” [15]. A Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev, he released his first periodic table with 66 elements in 1869. Meyer also released his second version periodic table in 1870, which was based on his original structured table in 1864. Kemp (1998) showed that Mendeleev has emerged other people’s idea about periodic table to shows that the relationship between atomic weights and chemical properties by some laws, especially, the Newlands’s Law of Octaves inspirited his most idea of periodic table [16]. Woods (2010) indicated that Mendeleev was known as “the Father of the Periodic Table”, although Meyer has published similar results with Mendeleev [17]. Sterling (1996) showed that despite the fact that Meyer’s research emphasis on the physical properties of the chemical elements, but his division of the elements of family model is more complete if compared with Mendeleev’s work. And also, his work shows that there has been clear evidence about transition element group, which is better than the Mendeleev’s published his first periodic table at the same year [18]. Unfortunately, Meyer not only did not to determine the modification of atomic weight is not accurate, but also he did not predict unknown elements according to periodic law, so there have more mistakes that he made for future work. Another comparison is between Lavoisier and Mendeleev about chemical elements. Hendry (2005) indicated that Lavoisier and Mendeleev have different conception about chemical elements. Lavoisier stated that chemical elements could be the form of the “compositional nomenclature” due to he isolated the elements from chemical compounds. On the other hand, Mendeleev provided the idea of the similarity and difference between the elemental substances [19]. In other words, Lavoisier give us an idea about what the periodic table should be looking like, and Mendeleev give us an idea of how we classify the difference between chemical elements. Modern periodic table was developed during 20th Century. Hamilton (2012) indicated that a British chemist William Ramsay, who won the Nobel Prize of Chemistry in 1904 for his “determination of their place (inert gaseous elements) in the periodic system”, which we called noble gases today [20]. His work is very important for future development of the periodic table, because it led to creating a new section of the periodic table. Nagendrappa (2011) showed that Ernest Rutherford, who is a New Zealand-born British physicist, he discovered the radioactivity is due to decay atom in 1900 [21]. His work also very important to development of the periodic table, because it gives an idea how to organize the radioactive elements in the periodic table. Rutherford (1915) described Henry Moseley, who was an English physicist, he uses X-ray to order the chemical elements due to different elements has different emission when X-rayed [22]. However, he is ordering the elements by atomic number rather than atomic weight, and also he modified “Periodic Law”. Horace Groves Deming, who was an American chemist, he published an 18-column periodic table in his book, which is recognized as the standard form of periodic table layout (Deming, 1923) [23]. This is provided a foundation to the modern periodic table layout that we see today. The last modified version of the periodic table was made by Glenn Theodore Seaborg, who was an American chemist. Ghiorso (1999) indicated that Glenn shared a Nobel Prize of Chemistry with Edwin M. McMillan in 1951 for their discovered the transuranium elements [24]. Seaborg (1951) stated that he “written one of the most brilliant pages in the history of discovery of chemical elements” in his Nobel lecture in 1951 [25]. Butera (2000) showed that before Seaborg won a Nobel Prize, he found that there has been significant mistake about the uranium and other natural heavies elements placed in the periodic table by Dmitri Mendeleev in 1869. Seaborg wrote “I was warned at the time that it was professional suicide to promote this idea, which has since been called one of the most significant changes in the periodic table since Mendeleev’s 19th century design”, and then he restructure the periodic table [26]. Kauffman &amp; Kauffman (2002) showed that Seaborg’s team discovered element 106 in 1974, today we called Seaborgium for his honour [27]. Furthermore, it seems like the periodic table did not finish, or the stable elements are finished. According to Scerri (2008), at the begin of the 20th Century, scientists found that ordering chemical elements by their atomic number is more important than the atomic weight. The periodic system is still growing up because according to Newlands’s Law of Octaves, there could find more elements with similar properties [28]. Currently, the periodic table has 118 elements. Fricke, Greiner &amp; Waber (1971) indicated that the elements in periodic table could up to 172 according to “Hartree-Fock-Slater program”, and also element or atomic weight could not higher than 175 due to “nobody knows what is happening when the 1s level drops into the negative continuum” [29]. So the next question for the scientist is what will happen to current periodic table? Here is some issues that may need to solve: (1) does the element 0 is existing; (2) possible opposite direction of periodic table development; (3) unresolved issues with the location of hydrogen and helium elements and (4) do we need a molecular periodic table? Above all, the periodic table has been updated to 118 elements since 1789 when Lavoisier published his first table. Early evidence shows that the periodic table could be organised by different theories or laws. However, the modern theory is ordering the chemical elements by their atomic number. Nevertheless, the periodic table has helped scientist to identify and verify a known or unknown element by its properties, and also helped to make chemistry useful in diverse areas, such as material, energy, environment and life science. The periodic table played a crucial role in science revolution, and the structure or layout was changed rapidly during the last 200 years. Scientists may need another century to work out the relationship between the quantum mechanical atom and atomic periodicity. References:[1] Forbes, R. M., Cooper, A. R., &amp; Mitchell, H. H. (1953).

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: Take one of the areas of astronomy, optics, or the physics of motion. Give an overview of Newton’s theories in this area and explain how they are advances over what came before.Lecturer’s Name: Ed MaresDate: 11st May, 2015Word Count: 2043 Sir Isaac Newton (1642 – 1727) was playing a significant role in the scientific revolution back to the 17th century. In particular, in the area of the physics of motion, his three laws of motion changed the world after he published the book Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, which it provided the explanation of the laws of motion in physics, and also it applied to another areas, for example applied the second Newton’s law to astronomy to measure the distance between celestial bodies. However, why Newton’s theories is more important to others, and what Newton improved his theories from others, and how Newton changed the world in physics. This essay will discuss the advantages of Newton’s laws compared with several scientist’s theories before Newton, which included Aristotle (384BC – 322BC), Jean Buridan (1295 – 1358), Galileo Galilei (1564 – 1642), René Descartes (1595 – 1650), Edme Mariotte (1620 – 1684), Christiaan Huygens (1629 – 1695) and Christopher Wren (1632 – 1723). And also will discuss the person who against Newton’s theory in the 17th century, which included Robert Hooke (1635 – 1707). During Newton’s working period, three basic ideas came up and applied to the physics of motion, but not the modern physics. Newton’s Three Laws of Motion was introduced after scientists tested and verified these laws past near three hundred years. According to Mares’s lecture notes (2015), the first law describes the meaning of force – the force can change the state of motion of objects, like remain in static or uniform motion in a straight line. The second law describes the effects of force – under the action of external force, more force acting on object, there will be more acceleration on the object too. The third law describes the nature of force – force is the interaction between objects, they are equal and opposite reaction [1]. And also, Newtons’ Cardle was a very important physical demonstration unit based on the Newton’s oscillations of pendulum theory. First of all, because Aristotle, the systematic of the physical world was developed. According to Jammer (1957), Aristotle’s concept of force is the motion is natural, spontaneous and forced [2]. In other words, static is the natural state of the object, if there is no force would be no movement. This statement is wrong, if we consider the Newton’s first law of motion. It missed the force could make the object move and stop move. Kosman (1969) shows that Aristotle defined motion is that “motion is the actualization of what potentially is.” [3] This is seems to be the right definition for motion, however, it does not say what motion actually is and where is come from. Kragh &amp; Brush (2001) indicated that Aristotle is the first person who proposed there has the relationship between force and motion [4]. Newton was further developed the Aristotle’s motion theory, he extend the external force can change the state of motion of objects. Another incorrect statement made by Aristotle was that he did not explain if there has been opposite direction force acting on the object, it will go the opposite direction. In addition, Jean Buridan who was a French priest. In Sicence and Its Times (2001), it shows that he actually changed Aristotle’s statement, which is the object was surrounded by air, and it can keep the object moving [5]. He was correct during that time, because he stated that the weight of the object could change its speed, and air resistance could slow the object down during motion. Trasancos (2014) indicated that Buridan’s statement was help Newton builds his first law of motion [6]. As a result, Newton was improved his motion theory, that an object could change its state of motion by the force acting on the object. Furthermore, Galileo Galilei was another people play an important role in the scientific revolution. Mares (2015) introduced that the famous drop experiment that he did at the Leaning Tower of Pisa shows that falling movement does not relate with the specific features of the object, like mass, material and size [7]. In other words, whether wood or iron ball they will reach the ground at the same time, if they drop off at the same place and same time. If no air resistance, light and heavy objects falling speed is the same, namely the value of the acceleration of gravity is the same. Cardall &amp; Daunt (n.d.) indicated that in lecture, Galileo most contribution to physics is that the concept of inertia, and it was considered that was “cornerstone” of Newton’s law of motion [8]. As a result, Newton’s first law of motion also called as the law of inertia sometimes. According to Bothun’s lecture notes (n.d.), Galileo was did some improvements from Aristotle’s statement. Firstly, he developed the velocity in the concept of motion in his inclined experiment, which is related to speed and direction. Secondly, the force is the cause of the motion. Thirdly, the object always has a velocity whether is in static or uniform motion. Finally, if the object refuses to change the state of motion, it called inertia. On the other hand, Newton through a series of experiments to verify whether Galileo’s statements true or not. As a consequence, Newton did some improvements from Galileo’s statements. First of all, he changed velocity to acceleration in the cause of force happened. Secondly, change of resistance in velocity is related to the mass of an object. Finally, the motion energy (force energy) is equal to mass times velocity [9]. Moreover, René Descartes was played a significant role during Newton’s Laws of Motion. Slowik (2013) indicated that Newton’s Laws of Motion is “modeled” the Descartes’s three laws of nature [10]. Bain (n.d.) shows that Descartes’ three laws of nature were caused by God. Law one is about everything always keep the same sate, if there has external force acting on it, it will change the state. Law two is about everything always keep moving in a straight line if there has the force keep acting on the object. Law three is about the resistance force acting on an object will change the motion of it [11]. Here is what Descartes say in his book: “I suppose as a second rule that, when one of these bodies pushes another, it cannot give the other any motion except by losing as much of its own at the same time; nor can it take away from the other body’s motion unless its own is increased by as much.” [12] In my opinion, Descartes describe the very important phenomenon in physics, which is object only change its state when another object acting motion on it. Hsieh (2007) also shows that Newton developed a Cartesian theory of motion of physics, and he examines the relationship between power of body and space [13]. In short, the exclusion of power from the body could reduce the space in the body. And this is explain the power (or force) can change the state of body motion, and if there has no force on body, the body does not move. Bennett (2013) indicated that Descartes describe two places that can be moved by the force acting on the body, one is the surface of body, another is the position of one body compare to other bodies [14]. It was related to the Newton’s second law and the third law, if we consider the force acting on the object, and the force between two objects. Edme Mariotte described the result of oscillations of the pendulum after he did the pendulum experiment, which was Newton use the result developed his Newton’s Cardle after years later (Cross, 2012). He was developed pendulum experiment to clarify that heavy objects are falling toward the centre (Complete Dictionary of Scientific Biography, 2008) [15]. The Newton’s pendulum experiment is about when the most on the right hand side of the ball swing collision of closely arranged other four balls, only the most on left hand side of the ball will be ejected. And also, the article also shows that Mariotte published a book called Traité de la percussion ou choc des corps in 1673, and give the four definitions of “inelastic body”, “elastic body”, “relative velocity” and “suppositions” corresponding to following statements: (1) the law of inertia in physics; (2) there has relationship between the speed of falling objects and the height of falling place according to Galileo’s theory; (3) the falling speed is related to the path during the falling; and (4) small oscillations happened during the tautochronism of pendulums [15]. Cross (2012) indicated that Newton’s Cradle was announced after Newton repeated the Mariotte’s collision of pendulum experiment, but Newton further discussed the influence of air resistance and ways to improve it, and also he corrected the experimental results [16]. Christiaan Huygens was another person who gives some idea to Newton on the theory of collision of the pendulum. Blackwell &amp; Huygen (1977) shows that Huygens have two hypothesises when he doing the collision of pendulum experiment – (1) any objects will move in straight line with the same speed if it in motion, but it will stopped if there has a force against it; (2) two hard objects will rebounding if they have the same speed and opposite move direction with other one [17]. One article issued by Rice University (2011) shows that Huygens agreed Descartes statements about objects close to each other with the same velocities, and both Descartes and Huygens influenced Newton future statement about the law of conservation of momentum [18]. In addition, Newton was established the law about the quantity of motion, which it takes him to further developed an idea about momentum based on his three laws of motion. Same as Huygens, Christopher Wren also did the collision of pendulum experiment. Dahmen (2014) indicated that Newton was “inspired” on the earlier Mariotte and Wren experiments, he was more interesting on the momentum transfer between the colliding pendulums during the experiment [19]. Elmes (1852) shows that Wren through various experiments to verify his hypothesis, which he through mechanics to studies subjects in “elastic collisions” and “pendulum motions” [20]. Newton (1687) in his book said about Wren and Huygens theories is “By the theory of Wren and Huygens, bodies absolutely hard return one from another with the same velocity with which they meet.” [21] According to Newton’s third law of motion as I talked before, there has been a force exists between two objects with the same velocity and opposite force direction. Newton was in fact proved Wren and Huygens hypothesises, and further improved the theory. However, Robert Hooke who was an English philosopher. Purrington (2009) described the relationship between Hooke and Newton was like an enemy, because during that time Newton was against Hooke’s statement due to Newton got far more influence at the Royal Society of London. And also, Purrington (2009) shows that Hooke is the first person sated the inverse square law of gravity, I mean before Newton [22]. The inverse square law of gravity was based one the Newton’s third law of motion. However, Newton took the credit from Hooke, because he got more influence than Hooke at the Royal Society. As a result, Hooke’s gravitation theory influenced Newton, I will not talk about in this essay, because it belongs to the Newton’s astronomy area, but most of Newton’s astronomy achievements are based on his three laws of motion. In conclusion, Newton was a well-known scientist. Not only he further improved someone ideas or statement but also he uses his statements applied to other subject areas. Firstly, Newton was through several experiments to re-implement other scientists’ experiments to verify their theories whether wrong or not. If their theories were wrong, Newton would correct it and then published on his book. Secondly, if their theories were correct, Newton would further develop his own theory, which means his will extend the “old” theories to the next “new” level. In other worlds, the new theories will represent other people’s vulnerability or weakness. Beyond his work in the physics of motion, he also did marvellous work in other areas, like mathematics, astronomy and optics. However, there has a dark-side of Newton, he did not recognize other people’s work because he got more power on the Royal Society. But we have to admire Newton was the most influential intellectual ever. References:[1] Mares, E. (2015). Newton’s Physics. Unpublished lecture notes, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand.

Consider technological capability, societal implications, and potential progress traps that might arise with rapid growth of this technology and make a summary judgement whether, in light of both the benefits and the likely costs and compromises, the development of such a technology should be pursued or, considering the uncertainties, if there is a case for a ‘progress experiment’ – in which case, which side of those experiments NZ should be on?Lecturer’s Name: Uli Zuelicke, Elf Eldridge &amp; Nick AgarDate: 13rd Feburary, 2015Word Count: 2203 Recently, nuclear power is a popular worldwide problem. The unclear power technology involved in different scientific areas, such as sociology, psychology, biology, geology, chemistry, physics and mathematics. The reason for those scientific areas involved in unclear power is because when government plan to build a nuclear reactor, it need to consider the social effect, the environmental effect and economic effect. For example, how residents think the unclear power, how to choose the best location of unclear power and what kind of control software should use. This technology is commonly used today, but it must be discreetly used and well protected by the government. By the definition of nuclear power, we know that nuclear power is using nuclear energy to generate electricity. If we go through the history of nuclear power disaster, we could find three world well-known nuclear power accidents are Three Mile Island disaster in USA in 1978, Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine in 1986 and Fukushima disaster in Japan in 2011. The impact of those two nuclear power is far-reaching, which including environmental pollution, unclear power safety issue and financial crisis. This essay will discuss several issues associated with nuclear power which include environmental, social and economic areas. The impact of nuclear power can be split into three areas, which in environmental, social and economic areas. First of all, the impact of nuclear power in the environmental area is unrecoverable, or could say the natural environment needs a very long time to recover before the situation of nuclear accident happened. According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2013), the environmental impact of unclear energy could be divided in five areas, which include air emissions, water resource, water discharges, uranium fuel waste and radioactive waste effect [1]. Firstly, as we know, nuclear energy is clean energy, it does not discharge carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides or sulphur dioxide as known as greenhouse gas. Nevertheless, when people refined uranium out of the ore and the process of uranium enrichment, it produced greenhouse gas like we talked about before. According to World Nuclear Association (2014), the waste from uranium mining is radon gas, which is the radioactive gas could cause cancer [2]. And also, World Nuclear Association (2015), the main greenhouse gas such as carbon dioxide will emit from the electricity used for uranium enrichment which is generated from coal. However, it only occupies 0.1% of the total amount of carbon dioxide emit from coal power station [3]. Secondly, the water used in the steam generator and turbine generator. According to Union of Concerned Scientists (n.d.), the nuclear power station uses water in three different ways: processing uranium fuel, generating electricity, and controlling uranium waste [4]. First main water usage is that the nuclear reactor will heat the water which it stored in a water tower, and then the water in the water tower gets hot to produce steam, then steam will push the generator working to generate electricity. Second main water usage is that the water condensed in the nuclear power station, the function of water condenser is providing water to the steam generator and cools down the turbine. Thirdly, the water discharges from a nuclear reactor, according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2013), water pollutants usually have high temperature, and it can influence the water quality and aquatic life in water [1]. Union of Concerned Scientists. (n.d.) also indicated that the water waste could contaminate local water resources, especially, the radioactive water waste could be dangerous for living creatures in the water may cause mutation or death. The power station only can discharge the radioactive water when they got wastewater permit, otherwise, the wastewater is “clean” [4]. Fourthly, the uranium fuel waste need to remove and replace every 18 to 24 months according to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (2013) [1]. So where this fuel wastes go? NRC (2002) shows that most of fuel waste will encase in a protective steel container, which the container could maintain 300 to 1,000 years without any damages. Other fuel waste will go to research lab by government permit, like university [5]. However, depending on Institute for Energy and Environmental Research, the half-life of Uranium-238 is 4.46 billion years, Uranium-238 is 704 million years and Uranium-238 is 245,000 years (http://ieer.org/resource/factsheets/uranium-its-uses-and-hazards/). It will take a very long time until the radioactivity disappears. Finally, the radioactive waste, unlike the uranium fuel waste, the radioactive waste is belonging to low level radioactive waste according to NRC (2002) [5]. The waste includes closed power station, radioactive equipment and structural materials. The famous example is Chernobyl disaster, according to World Nuclear Association (2014), the exploration affect land area within a 30-kilometre radius, and 45,000 residents living in this area. Around 60% of Belarus land area was affected by radioactive pollutants [6]. After 30 years, the evacuated area is still not suitable for human habitation, it becomes a dead zone. Depending on Power Reactor Information System (PRIS) built by IAEA, currently, we have 439 nuclear power reactors in operation around 30 countries in the world, 69 under construction and 2 is shutdown now (https://www.iaea.org/pris/Home.aspx). The following table shows that the International Nuclear and Radiological Event Scale defined by International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (http://www-ns.iaea.org/tech-areas/emergency/ines.asp). Level Definition Accident/Incident 7 Major Accident Accident 6 Serious Accident Accident 5 Accident with Wider Consequences Accident 4 Accident with Local Consequences Accident 3 Serious Incident Incident 2 Incident Incident 1 Anomaly Incident 0 No Safety Significance N/A Both of Chernobyl disaster and Fukushima disaster belongs to level 7 - major accidents, which means it will cause long-term consequences for the environment. Secondly, the social impact of the nuclear power is another main factor of unclear power technology. DeLay &amp; Parkins (2011) shows that if ask people to judge the risks, they will focus on “a border set of concerns” [7]. According to NEA (1993), the social impacts of nuclear power could be changing the employment levels, “risk perceptions”, social agreements and cultural impact [8]. First of all, unclear power technology could impact the employment levels. NEA (1993) shows that the nuclear power industry needs highly skilled workers and graduated staffs who relevant to their major could work at the nuclear power industry [8]. The demand of those kind of people is very high, and need have few years of working experience. For example, 4% of total employees worked at nuclear power industry in France. The proportion of the total amount of workers is small, but the industry cannot find the worker who has appropriate skills. In addition, potential risks are also come with the nuclear power industry, because “these risks are unknown, dreadful, uncontrollable, inequitable, catastrophic and likely to affect future generation” (Slovic, 1987, p 236) [9]. According to Nelkin (1981), before the Three Mile Island accident happened in 1979, government compare nuclear power risks and benefits, and then choose nuclear power as one of the electricity provider [10]. However, after the accident, people start to change their risk perceptions, they more concern their health and environment, not the benefits of nuclear power, such as lower electricity cost and greenhouse gas emissions. Thirdly, social agreements also changed when nuclear power becomes popular. Tsivoglou (1971) indicated that the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) plays an important role between the federal government and U.S. citizens. The principal conflict between the federal government and U.S. citizens is that nuclear waste disposal, environmental effects, potential fuel leaking risks, radiation hazards and cost of nuclear power. The final decision was made by the federal government is that build the nuclear power station with full protection of earth, air and water, and also reduced the risk of human radiation exposure at a very low level [11]. After years of nuclear power become popular, United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) was established by the Energy Reorganization Act, which is playing a very important role to control the use of nuclear power and nuclear waste. Some laws or acts come after based on the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 to protect both of nuclear use of civilian and military, such as Nuclear Waste Policy Act 1982, National Environmental Policy Act and the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act 1978 (http://www.nrc.gov/about-nrc/governing-laws.html). Finally, the cultural impact is another social impact of unclear power. Slovic, Flynn, Mertz, Poumadere &amp; Mays (2000) indicated that the cultural impact of unclear power is not easily changed by “public information or educational campaigns” [12]. Chernobyl disaster as an example, according to Marples &amp; Saunders’s (1991) article, the Ukrainian culture began to look dreary after the leaders of Ukrainian society had been bought off by the tsars of the Russian Empire [13]. It is not surprised, as we know, the Soviet Union was dissolute in 1991 just after the Chernobyl disaster happened in 1986. As Ukraine is a part of the Soviet Union, Russian or Ukrainian culture began to take a bad turn. Ryu &amp; Meshkati (2014) shows that the “safety culture” was introduced after the Fukushima disaster in 2001, which is the culture can be avoided an accident [14]. IAEA (1992) indicated that “the accident can be said to have flowed from deficient safety culture, not only at the Chernobyl plant, but throughout the Soviet design, operating and regulatory organizations for nuclear power that existed at the time” (http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub913e_web.pdf). Finally, nuclear power could affect the economic area. First of all, unclear power could potentially increase the job opportunity and labour income. According to Nuclear Energy Institute (2015), the average cost of a nuclear plant is about USD 470 million (NZD 637.5 million), the labour income is USD 40 million (NZD 54.3 million) that included in the total cost of nuclear plant. And also, every unclear plant will create 400 to 700 permanent job opportunities, the salaries paid to these workers are higher than other jobs in the local area. Moreover, it also creates additional jobs to provide services to these workers. As a result, every new power plant could potentially create more than 3,500 jobs opportunities in the local area [15]. It is benefit to local government and local economies growth. However, the Economist (2009) shows that the unclear power is uneconomical, because unlike America offered to nuclear plant, which includes loan guarantees, tax breaks and cover cost overruns, the Britain government could not give such benefits to a nuclear plant. And also, the cost of waste disposes could be very high [16]. All these facts could cause a huge gap to open up in government financial deficit. The World Nuclear Association (2015) shows that the cost of nuclear power could be divided in three areas: capital costs, plant operating costs and external costs. Capital costs are the cost of construction and commissioning a new nuclear plant. It will create huge job opportunity. Plant operating costs are included in the cost of uranium conversion and enrichment, for example, it will take around USD 2,360 (NZD 3,200) to get 1kg of uranium fuel in 2013. External costs include the cost of accident insurance and nuclear waste disposal [17]. However, if we compared with costs of other technology to generate electricity, according to NEA (2010), the lowest cost of electricity generation is nuclear technology around USD 8.3 to 13.7 per kWh at 10% discount rate and around USD 5.0 to 8.2 per kWh at 5% discount rate [18]. Edwards (1982) indicated that the nuclear power plant in Argentina is more about military and strategic, and they did not focus on the economy [19]. As we know, the nuclear power does not have greenhouse emissions, so it not contributes global warming. So the cost of solving global warming could be dropped if the government decided to develop nuclear energy. However, after the Fukushima disaster, litigation movement begins to ask the government take responsibly for Fukushima disaster. And also, most countries have undertaken to advocate the denuclearization movement (http://fukushimaontheglobe.com/citizens-movement/litigation-movement). Back to New Zealand, New Zealand is a nuclear-free zone country. According to World Nuclear Association (2014), New Zealand published the Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act 1987 to establish the NZ nuclear free zone to avoid the impact of nuclear power [20]. This essay examines unclear power influenced the environmental, social and economic in human world. Unclear power is still a serious problem in today’s society, although people try to find clean and renewable resources. Because of unclear power has many problems and many accidents in the past fitty years, unclear power has become the most significant part of our life. The potential risks of unclear power could be affecting human health and normal government operations. In addition to the influence of carbon dioxide, it will produce significant cost or benefit the future nuclear power investment, beyond those reflected in the resource cost analysis. And also, there has many hidden cost when people decide using unclear power. The unclear disasters we talked about before, like Three Mile Island disaster in USA, Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine and Fukushima disaster in Japan. This three cases inexperience, irresponsible and ignorance are played important roles during the accidents. In this case, it is likely to minimise the total cost of electricity generation, at the same time, consider the plant is expected the cost of living, it will keep the long-term fiscal strategy. In the future, people could find more renewable resources without using nuclear power if we run out non-renewable resources. References:[1] U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. (2013).

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: Explore the opportunities and challenges offered by one of the following technological developments discussed in this module: 3D printing, solar energy and solar cells, nanoparticles, big-data information gathering/processing, genetically modified crops/organisms or nuclear power. Consider technological capability, societal implications, and potential progress traps that might arise with rapid growth of this technology and make a summary judgement whether, in light of both the benefits and the likely costs and compromises, the development of such a technology should be pursued or, considering the uncertainties, if there is a case for a ‘progress experiment’ – in which case, which side of those experiments NZ should be on?Lecturer’s Name: Uli Zuelicke, Elf Eldridge &amp; Nick AgarDate: 9th Feburary, 2015Word Count: 1126 The questions are involved in this topic: What is the science under discussion? For this topic, I want to talk about 3D printing technology. The 3D printing technology involved in the following scientific areas: sociology, psychology, functional biology, physics and mathematics. The reason for sociology involved in this topic is because we need consider law, ethics and economics issues associated with 3D printing technology. For example, is the 3D printing is legal to everyone, and what problems with 3D printing development? Secondly, the psychology involved in this topic is because we want to know why 3D printing become more and more popular. Next, like Eldridge (2014) shows that there has been a possibility that people can print out body tissue through a 3D printer. As a result, the functional biology is involved in this topic, because there still have problem associated with body tissue printing. For example, did printable body tissue have rejection on human body? In addition, the physics is involved in this topic is because the materials we used in 3D printing technology, such as metal, plastic and ceramics. And also, different 3D printer has different 3D printing function. Finally, the mathematics, the software designed for 3D printing, such as FreeCAD that I used when I doing ENGR 101, and also have Google SketchUp, AutoCAD, Maya, Rhine3D, etc. Some of software are very easy to use, but some of is hard to handle for beginner. So the question is can we design the product without using software, or can computer understand what we are thinking, like mind reader. Where does the motivation come from to carry out this research? Love (2013) indicated that as a DIY-er, the 3D printing technology will assist you a lot. The reason is they can make any piece of the tool that they want, and they do not have to find the tool from a local tool shop or online shop. Especially, if they make a product that very unique if compare with the commercial product. Another possible use for DIY-er is furniture repair, if one part of furniture was broken, they just need to use 3D scanner to scanner the broken part, and then using software to fix it. Finally, using 3D printer prints out the part that they want to fix it. Kuneinen (2013) shows an example that people using 3D printing technology to fix the missing clips on IEKA PULT Ceiling Lamp. So 3D printing technology is extremely helpful to DIY-er or thinker. Furthermore, the 3D printing technology could be helpful in the education area. One of the article “Importance of 3D printing in Education” (2014) shows that the 3D printing technology could benefit to education, for example, teachers can use 3-dimensional models to help student learns architecture, engineering or arts (http://www.educatorstechnology.com/2013/03/importance-of-3d-printing-in-education.html). For instance, this is might to help students to find out the structure of the building or engineering principle. How is the research carried out? Victoria University of Wellington’s Design School recently launched a programme that is to find out what human can be done with 3D printing technology. The article also said using recyclable plastic material to melt it into a 3D printer which the material is suitable use in printer (http://www.victoria.ac.nz/research/expertise/architecture-design/3d-printing). Wheeler (2015) indicated that the molecular biologist in California, USA recently using 3D-printed models to find out how HIV working and how HIV acting in our human body. Nowadays, Choi (2014) shows that researchers using 4D printing technology to print out dynamic 3D structures which it can change their shapes at any time. Who are the different ‘voices’ related to this topic; who can be trusted and why? Well, there are two sides to everything. Gilpin (2014) shows that there have ten disadvantages come with 3D printing technology. 1) 3D printers use more power than normal machine; 2) 3D printers can release unhealthy gas; 3) consume more plastic, not environmental friendly; 4) copyright problem; 5) plastic gun problem; 6) 3D printer manufacturer responsibility to everyone; 7) “bioprinting” issue; 8) 3D print drugs problem; 9) security problem; 10) safety problem with food. In addition, the news article “The Good, the Bad &amp; the Ugly of 3D Printing” (2014) shows that the world’s first 3D printable gun was released by DefenSe Distributed, which they try to put their 3D gun blueprints on Internet (http://www.labmate-online.com/news/news-and-views/5/breaking_news/the_good_the_bad_the_ugly_of_3d_printing/31720/). That is very dangerous to normal people, criminal can use 3D printer to print out the plastic gun and plastic bullet to shoot people, even pass the airport security check. What is the social and political context of this science? The most important issue drives this science topic is that social security problem. The 3D printable plastic gun is the most popular issue to let people think the new technology could probably impact our normal life. Neal (2013) suggested that the security department should do a background check before someone buying 3D printer from a shop or online store. And also the serial number and registration should be recorded in the national security system. Zurcher (2014) shows that the larger issue come with 3D printing technology is that responsibility. If people killed or hurt by someone, are the responsible of the printer owner, the manufacturer of 3D printer, or the person give the idea to produce such product. What issues exist around communication of this science? As we talked before, the issues that come with 3D printing technology are from different areas, such as economy and society. If the 3D printing technology becomes more and more popular in the future, the labour will lose their job, because people can produce the product themselves without buying from shop. So the demand of the product will decrease, and the demand of labour will decrease too. Another issue is a society problem when 3D printer becomes cheaper and cheaper, the price of 3D printer is affordable to normal people, people can print anything that they want have. It will not surprise people can print out airplane, rocket or missile as long as they got the model blueprint. Considering all of the above, what is your conclusion about the question posed in the essay title? To sum up, the cost of 3D printer is become lower and lower, ultimately, everyone can afford a home-use 3D printer, like a normal printer we used today. The pace of 3D printing technology development should not just stop because of some of the problems around it. There is no such law or act applied to 3D printing technology in New Zealand. In the future, scientist probably could develop a 3D printer that can automatically print the owner ID on the printable product. So that people can identify the owner of the product, and also other people cannot use this product because it not approved by the owner. References Zuelicke, U. (2014). Lecture notes 1~2.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: Discuss anthropogenic climate change considering both (a) the physical processes that drive the climate system, and (b) technologies and strategies that can be used to address this issue. Which response(s) do you think are the most important, and why?Lecturer’s Name: Dan Zwartz, Dave Frame &amp; Rebecca FordDate: 30th January, 2015Word Count: 1077 The questions are involved in this topic: What is the science under discussion? When we talk about climate change, not only the climate involved in the discussion but also sociology, psychology, chemistry, physics, mathematics and geoscience involved in this discussion [1]. Why? The reason is that the climate change may also relate to the law, ethics and economics issues, such as the law apply to mitigate global warming and the impact of climate change on the world economy. The psychology involved in climate change is due to the way to find the solution of climate change, like how people react to climate change, including anxious, stress and apathetic. The chemistry involved in climate change is because climate change may cause the chemical reaction, for example, the formation of acid rain could due to amounts of sulfur dioxide combine add to the atmosphere. The physics involved in climate change is because we can use physics to explain the approach of human activities changing the climate, for instance, the relationship between human activities on earth and emissions of greenhouse gas. Like Zwartz said “climate change is also very much about statistics”, the climate change also involved in mathematics, because we can use data we collected to analyze the climate change, it is similar with the weather forecast we watch everyday, however the climate change is forecasting the situation after decades [3]. The geoscience is more like the results of climate change, such as the influence of tropical cyclones and destruction of the Amazon ecosystem. Where does the motivation come from to carry out this research? The motivation of solving the climate problem is related to human psychology. When people concerned with their health or income, they will consider the impact of climate change. As a result, people will try to find a solution to climate change. For example, people will try to reduce the usage of fossil fuel because it may cause global warming. Semenza, Ploubidis &amp; George (2011) indicated that human should consider both individual and society could impact climate change, especially, it could prevent devastating consequences [4]. Petrovic, Madrigano &amp; Zaval (2014) also shows that public health messaging or advertising could affect the climate change mitigation [5]. According to Ministry for the Environment (2014) report, based on human activities nowadays, there have four impacts may happened in New Zealand – higher temperatures, sea level increasing, extreme weather events increasing and rainfall patterns change [6]. How is the research carried out? IPCC Third Assessment Report (2001) indicated that there have two different factors could drive the climate system. First of all, the ultimate source of energy, which means the sun radiation. The climate system function is that to balance the incoming solar radiation which including “electromagnetic spectrum” and “ultraviolet spectrum”, and outgoing radiation which including infrared radiation, sensible heat and water vapour. Secondly, human activities influence the climate system. Since the first of the Industrial Revolution, mid-18th century, the impact of human activities was dramatically increased, particularly the combustion of fossil fuels produces greenhouse gas. And also, the urbanisation and other human activities, like lumbering and farming will affect the physical and biological properties on earth. The greenhouse effect was introduced in this part, which means most of the greenhouse gas from human activities is in the atmosphere, and the greenhouse gas is absorbed the heat from outgoing radiation. As a result, the atmosphere gets hotter and hotter, so the temperature of the earth surface is increasing when greenhouse gas emission is increasing [7]. Who are the different ‘voices’ related to this topic; who can be trusted and why? Biello (2014) shows that there has ten possible solutions to saving our planet: 1) using fossil fuels smart; 2) upgrade our infrastructure, like our building; 3) move closer to work and study, or using public transport; 4) reduce consumption, like fossil fuels; 5) living efficient way, like buy efficient car; 6) eat more vegetable; 7) stop cutting trees; 8) unplug your devices; 9) reduce birth rate; 10) future energy [8]. However, the IMF (2008) said the climate change will affect the economies, if we want have our economies growth, the GHG (greenhouse gas) emissions will increase. For example, the fast-growing countries like China and India, they contributed most of GHG emission [9]. In other words, the economic growth is based on the destruction of the natural environment. We cannot sacrifice our environment to develop our economic and high standard living. Like Biello said, we could do everything possible to try saving our environment rather than sacrificing. What is the social and political context of this science? NASA (2015) shows that the action plans listed by the United States government and United Nation framework on climate change. For example, the Clean Power Plan was introduced by EPA in order to protect the health of future generation [10]. And also the EPA (2014) shows that what individual can do to try to reduce the emission of greenhouse gas. For instance, people can reduce pollution, reuse clothes and recycle newspaper, plastic bottle and other goods [11]. What issues exist around communication of this science? Liao (2010) indicated that there still have problems when we using renewable energy during our real world. For example, electricity storage is difficult to solve, because we need a large surface area to convert electricity and storage electricity [12]. The balance between the cost and electricity production is hard to maintain. On the other hand, the wind energy is clean and sustainable energy. However, good wind sites usually far away from cities where the power is needed, and also the wind turbine may have noise pollution and the turbine blades need to maintain the function [13]. Considering all of the above, what is your conclusion about the question posed in the essay title? To sum up, both the physical processes that drive the climate system, and technologies and strategies that can be used to address this issue are important. Because human activities drive the climate system, so that we need to find a solution to try to reduce the impact of climate change by human beings. One of the solution is that we can find new energies to replace our transitional energy, like nuclear power, solar power and wind power to replace the fossil fuels. However, we also need to consider the cost of new energy and economic growth. As a result, both of two factors are important to us, but only need is finding the balance between them.

    <title><![CDATA[Analyse the role of information business systems in decision-making process]]></title>
    <url>%2F2013%2F08%2F16%2Funi1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: Analyse the role of information business systems in decision-making processDate: 16th August, 2013Word Count: 1002 Recently, Schneider Electric SA which is a France-based energy management multinational corporation agreed to buy the Invensys Plc which is a UK-based global IT company for 3.4 billion pounds (approximately $6.5 billion NZD) to improve industry software and control systems. This purchase is helping Schneider extend their automation products to the automotive, aerospace, food and feed industry penetration. At the same time, Invensys automation software and hardware can also be used in power station, oil refineries and chemical plants. As a business manager, they should consider some questions before buying. For example, they should consider about the price of software, after-sale service and on-site service. In addition, they also should compare with other software product. As a result, that sample business case is leading to decision-making process for information business systems. This essay will discuss several cases which include three different factors involved decision processes. The first factor involved decision process is that technical factor. That means business manager should know some essential terminology and software concepts to help them to make a decision buying software and training staff for the company. According to a recent study (Kroenke &amp; Hooper, 2011) showed that business manager should consider the operating system and application program that used to improve business management. The example is Schneider buying software is for improve software system, so they should consider the software quality and quantity. Johnson (n.d.) introduced some questions that the company should consider before them buying, such as the price of software, software satisfaction and software scalable design, etc. So business manager should make a decision for buying software product. Beaupup &amp; Pashley (2013) showed that Invensys will help Schneider’s automation technology to solve European construction recession problem. For the Schneider buying IT company, they use advanced software is for improving their production technology. The second factor is that organizational factor. That means the company should consider the pros and cons for the company that they want to buy. The example is Schneider, which is an energy company that focus on data centre and network, energy and infrastructure construction, energy optimization and provide energy solutions. And also for Invensys, which is an IT company that deals with the production technology and energy management. As a result, the Invensys has a technology that Schneider wants to have. So Schneider could use Invensys resources to complementary customer bases and scales up the customer size. According to Harvard Business School guide, the company should also consider the social influence when they make a decision (Harvard Business School, 2006, p.117). For example, they should avoid conflict for different opinions and avoid criticism another unpopular opinions. In my opinion, Schneider probably has some different voices for buying Invensys, such as employee benefit and changes in top management. Because Schneider has 105,000 employees around 106 counties (http://www.schneider-electric.co.nz/sites/new-zealand/en/company/company.page) and the Invensys have 16,500 employees around 43 countries from their website (http://www.invensys.com/en/aboutus/). The employee benefit is related to the company earnings and the number of employee. And top management will be a challenge for Schneider caused by functional distribution is related to the number of management. So this is a decision-making for the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Schneider, he should consider those problems before buying. As a result of decision making could be effect by technical and organizational factors, but the result was indirect effect the final decision. The human factor will ultimately effect the decision making result. The third factor is that human factor. That means the manager should make a final decision on the company purchases. A recent study showed that human behaviours can also effect decision (Harvard Business School, 2006, p.99). It introduced server human behaviours could make a wrong decision or a bad decision. First of all, anchoring usually will take place the process of negotiations and discussions when make a decision. A “psychological anchor point” is generally building on the first people present an opinion (Harvard Business School, 2006, pp. 99-100). Secondly, overconfident usually happened when executives overconfident about their management ability. And also, this overconfidence usually will make a wrong decision. We could solve this problem by setting the number decision makers to challenge his/her decisions (Harvard Business School, 2006, pp.101-104). Thirdly, the past could also influence the decision maker, for example, sunk costs. Sunk costs was defined by has occurred or promised money that cannot be recovered costs (Harvard Business School, 2006, p.107). Finally, false analogies usually influence the decision maker about the experience that they learned before. They use their experience to help make a decision, but it also will guide their work and decision (Harvard Business School, 2006, pp.109-112). In a recent study, Higgs, Smith &amp; Mechling (2010) showed that if business manager make decisions within business organisation could lead to undesirable consequences. Ultimately, the three factors link to three decision levels. Kroenke &amp; Hooper (2011) indicated that three decision level in organizations: operational, managerial and strategic. As a result, operational decisions are related to daily activities, and also this decision level is concerned technical factor. Strategic decisions are related to organizational issues, and also this decision level is concerned organizational factor. Managerial decisions are related to distribution and exploitation of resources, and also this decision level is concerned human factor in decision-making process. This essay examines the role of decision-making in three factors that involved in information business systems, which are also linked to three decision levels in the organization. The decision-making process is an important business activity in organization, which the organizations usually have economics consultants in the process of buying product. In general, business manager should consider the three factors when they make a decision to buy new software or hardware or both. Perhaps, the organization should set up specific department like IT department to investigate software or hardware that they want to buy. However, the final decision was made by the groups, as well as information business systems to make it more efficiency for groups to make collaborative decisions.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: Compare and contrast the policies of government between 1911 and 1935, on the one hand, with the policies of the Labour government after 1935Teacher’s Name: Stevan Eldred-GriggDate: 24th January, 2012Word Count: 1170 A government policy is one of the government actions which the party in power makes some laws or acts to the country, and usually has extensive and far-reaching effects or consequences. Policy can be defined by “a set of plans or principles that are used as a basis for making decisions.” (Sinclair, 2005, p. 527) New Zealand government was governed by the Liberal Party and the Reform Party during 1911 to 1935 and also governed by the Labour Party after 1935. This essay will discuss several similarities of policies which in economic and social areas, and also will focus on differences of policies which have economy, society, house, education and health. The similarities in the policies of governments can be divided into three different areas, which in economics, macroeconomic and social areas. Firstly, economic policies are one of the similarities of the government policy. State ownerships, for example, can see that the government intervention in the national economy. The postal system, roads and railways had belonged to the state during 1911 to 1935 (FNDN025: Unite 3, pp.43-51). However, when New Zealand government governed by the Labour Party was obtained telecoms, airlines, the coal industry, the electricity industry and other important industries after 1935 (FNDN025: Unite 3, pp.50-51). As we can see the government continues to expand their influence in the economy that means the most economy was controlled by the state and not by private capitalists. Secondly, social policies were another similarity of the government policy. Whether the Reform State or the Welfare State, both they published a policy was helping poor people. For instance, when the Reform party governed the government of New Zealand has published a policy called ‘Square Deal’ during 1911 to 1935. The state claimed that the ‘Square Deal’ was benefit to all social classes, nevertheless, socialists think this policy is bad for the working class, so they called it is ‘Square Steal’ policy (FNDN025: Unite 3, p.41). After 1935, the Labour Party published a policy called ‘cradle to grave.’ It was supported almost all citizens which benefit to all sick, unemployed and elderly people and all children (FNDN025: Unite 3, p.50). On the other hand, it was also helping needy people by reliance on the charity (Ball, 2004, p.42). The third similarity is macroeconomic policy which is both states uses borrowed money invests in economic growth. The Jazz Age of the 1920s in New Zealand history, for example, the state develops the economy by borrowing money invests in economic areas (FNDN025: Unite 3, p.43). During the Great Depression in the early 1930s, New Zealand was one of the highest overseas debts in the world (Ball, 2004, p.42). Because amount of government’s income paid for the interest of debt, so the state invests in the economy was decreased. Finally, both the state policy was on the right that means they are the conservative state. The Reform Party was supported by landowners, farmers and the conservative middle class after 1911. In addition, the class war during 1912 to 1913 won by capitalists caused by their supported by the Reform state. Even if the Socialist Party which supported by labourers and skilled workers succeeded had one sit in the parliament of New Zealand in the 1911 election, the Reform state still hold most power of the state (FNDN025: Unite 3, p.41). The same situation has happened in the 1920s which the government was controlled by the Reform Party and the Liberal Party. Socialist policies were supported by only a few voters (FNDN025: Unite 3, p.43). In despite of the Welfare State, after 1935 have a ‘cradle to grave’ security system, the middle class and capitalist profited from exploiting of the working class (FNDN025: Unite 3, p.50). As seen in the story, different the policies of governments could have some similarities in diverse areas, such as economic and social areas. In other words, the government policies also could have differences between different governments. Overall, next section will focus on the policies of governments between 1911 and 1935 to contrast with the policies of the Labour government after 1935 which in economic, social, housing, health and education areas. The differences in the policies of governments can be separated into five areas, which have economic, social, housing, health and education policies. To begin with, one of the differences was between economic policies of governments. When the New Zealand government controlled by the Reform Party and the Liberal Party the Unemployment Act was introduced for men in 1930 by caused by the Great Depression made a lot of people unemployed during that time. People cannot get money until they did some work, such as road building and forests planting. After that, the Employment Promotion Act was published in 1936 which the Labour government abolished the Unemployment Act. The result was positive that sustenance and relief work rates were increased rapidly (Unemployment, Te Ara, 2009). Secondly, social policy was another difference between the governments. The Labour Party published the Social Security Act was introduced for all sick, unemployed, elderly people and all children in 1938 (Ball, 2004, p.42). Compared with other parties’ policies, the policy of the Labour Party was real benefit for almost all social classes. For instance, ‘Square Deal’ of the Reform Party’s policy was benefit for all social classed expect the working class. Furthermore, housing policy was the third difference of the policies of governments. As previously said the Social Security Act of 1938, under the policy state housing was built in the Welfare State. The Labour Party built a lot of state houses by reason that helps low income people have a cheap and good quality house (FNDN025: Unite 3, p.50). In comparison with other government policies, the Labour Party help the poor people improve their living standards. Fourthly, health policy is the first time introduced to all citizens. The Labour Party established the Social Security Act which includes support free health services to all citizens after 1935(FNDN025: Unite 3, p.50). On the other hand, this policy is the first time the state provides free health services benefit to all social classes in New Zealand history. Finally, education policy was the last difference of the policies of governments. Under the Social Security Act of 1938, the state began to provide free secondary education for all citizens. Free primary education was begun in 1877 when the state passed the Education Act (Swarbrick, Te Ara, 2009). Compared with other government policies, the Welfare State controlled by the Labour Party was the first time support all citizens with free secondary education in national history. This essay compares and contrasts the policies of governments between 1911 and 1935, and comparing with the policies of the Labour government after 1935 in different areas. As we can see, government’s policy usually introduced with the economic and social situation changes, and also the people of benefit from the policy changes. These policies, while significant individually, are have effect on all social groups. In other words, the policies of government need to all social classes are engaged. References:Sinclair, J.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: Examine the principal causes and effects of water pollutionTeacher’s Name: Rod JenkinsDate: 24th January, 2012Word Count: 1313 Recently, water pollution is a worldwide problem. As we know more than 70% of Earth’s surface was covered by water, however, scientists estimate only 0.01% of the water can be used for humans and animals. Water pollution can be defined by the water contains pollutants which have damaging chemicals and salvaged materials can make the water quality change and reduce the water exploitation value caused by animals or by humans. This essay will discuss several causes which include industries, agriculture and households, and also will focus on effects of water pollution which in the environmental, economic and social areas. The causes of water pollution can be divided in three areas, which in industrial, agricultural and household areas. Industrial pollution is one cause of water pollution. Industrial wastes, toxic chemicals and industrial accidents are belonging to industrial pollution. Firstly, discharges of industrial wastes, which usually come from factories or nuclear plants. One example of this is in the Cuyahoga River where polluted by chemicals, heavy metals and other stuffs during 1952 to 1953. According to a report, at least 155 tons of industrial wastes were directly discharged into the river every day (Gay, 1990, p. 16). Secondly, the process of manufacturing or producing was another pollution source. For example, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are kind of highly toxic chemicals. It is widely used to make circuit boards. But now most countries have banned it. As the widespread use of PCBs, people found this chemical material even in the body of bird and fish in the Arctic (Water pollution: an introduction, 2009). In spite of this, humans discharged about 0.5 million tons of PCBs into the environment in the 20th century. Finally, industrial accidents were another pollution source. Benzene a kind of oil used to make plastics and chemical products, which are a highly toxic material. For instance, discharge of benzene into the Songhua River by the explosion at a factory in Harbin. As a result, about 3.8 million people affected by water supply and five peoples were killed by the water pollution incident (‘Toxic slick reaches city’, 2005, p. B1). The second principal causes of water pollution were agriculture, related to nutrients, stock excrement and farm wastes. Firstly, nutrients, which include chemical materials, such as nitrates and phosphates (Scarsbrook &amp; Rutherford, 2009). Farming fertilizer is an example of this. Especially, chemical fertilizers used to add nutrients to agricultural lands, which discharger into rivers or lakes. However, it can make algae or plankton growth dramatically which can remove oxygen from the water (Water pollution: an introduction, 2009). It is ultimately leading to death of fish and other organisms. Furthermore, stock excrement, which contains nitrogen and phosphorous has seep into farmland. For example, in Waikato total were 4,500 dairy farms and each year average 3.6 tonnes of nitrogen percolated. Then, they are leaking into the water (Irvine, 2008, p. 1). Finally, organic farm wastes are another type of water pollutant like silage or liquid slurry. One example of this is in the River Severn, where nearly ten thousand fish died, causing pig slurry leaked into a river can reduce oxygen in the water (Water pollution: an introduction, 2009). A final cause was households, related to waste water, plastics and human activities. To begin with, detergents are kind of washing compounds which used a household. However, it makes water become eutrophic resulting from the addition of nutrients and sediments. The problem is such algae will deplete oxygen in the water and threat to the survival of fish and other species. For example, a lot of U.S. lakes and streams became eutrophic with phosphorus during the 1960s caused by detergents discharged into rivers (Gay, 1990, p. 15). Secondly, plastics are not toxic chemicals, but plastics are damaging to fish, seabirds and other marine organisms. According to a scientific study, about 25% of whole seabirds include some plastic residues in the 1980s (Water pollution: an introduction, 2009). Thirdly, human activities are another type of water pollutant, like rubbish dumps. Rubbish can make a kind of mixture named leachate which can discharge into rivers and pollute the drinking water source (‘Rivers’, n.d.). As a result of water pollution, millions of tons toxic sources or nontoxic source discharge into water. The results were immediate, some will influence on the environment, some will influence on the economy, and some will influence society. However, ultimately affect humans. The effect was water pollution in the environmental area, such as acid rain and eutrophication. It consists of air or land, ecosystem and plants aquatic. Firstly, polluted air through rain falls on the land. The acid rain, for example, the rainwater contains sulphuric and nitric acids, which come from sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. It can turn into plants and animals, and even kill them or poison them such as fish and shellfish (‘Rivers’, n.d.). Secondly, water pollution can harm the ecosystem. Like, as before we called eutrophic in waterways can lead to oxygen reduced rapidly in the body of water that kill fish life. For instance, the Gulf of Mexico is one of the most dramatic dead zones that grow about 18,000 square kilometres algae or plankton in this area each summer (Water pollution: an introduction, 2009). Finally, water pollution also can harm aquatic plants. Lakes become an accumulation area which has fertilisers and nutrients will impact plant life. Lake Waikere, for example, the water becomes dirty and cloudy caused by it used 80-odd tonne each year from out of the lake (Irvine, 2008, p.1). The second principal effect of the water pollution was economic. To begin with, the economic cost is one of the economic benefits. Water pollution can bring economic cost when an oil spill happens. For example, the Rena oil spill which happened in 5th October last year has already cost taxpayers $25 million New Zealand dollars (Westbrook &amp; Cowlishaw, 2012). Secondly, people will spend money on agricultural pollution. For instance, the state of Waikato’s waterways, fisherman catches shortfin and longfin eels, but they found the size and number of eels was decreased. As a result, the government spends money to improve water quality (Irvine, 2008, p.1). Thirdly, water pollution also can improperly influence tourism. People will clean up the beaches when an oil spill occurs. At the same time, the tourist will decrease rapidly when the incident happens, because they do not want to see black oil or rubbish on beautiful beaches. The final principal effect of the water pollution was human society. Firstly, poison foods or radioactive waste can bring diseases to humans and influence health of humans. For example, when people eat poisoned shellfish they will get ill called paralytic shellfish poisoning. Another example is radioactive pollution in Europe. Britain and France have two nuclear power plants that both discharge radioactive waste water directly into water. As we know, radioactive pollution it can kill or can cause cancer (Water pollution: an introduction, 2009). Secondly, water pollution can make water unsuitable for drinking. For instance, when Harbin’s chemical factory spewed benzene into a river, the government turned off the tap water and people panicked buying bottled water, food and milk (‘Toxic slick reaches city’, 2005, p. B1). Finally, water pollution also can influence the community environment, such as lakes, rivers, beaches and schools. For example, local government closed schools during the accident at Harbin. Another example is the state closed the beaches when the Rena oil spill close to New Zealand. This essay examines the proposition that water pollution influenced the humans and nature, causing natural reasons and human activities. Water pollution is still a serious problem in today’s society. Drinking water and aquatic organisms, even humans will be affected by water pollution. In general, people can use hybrid car, eat genetically modified food and use of recycled materials in order to reduce pollution of the environment. Perhaps, people could be aware of solve the problem through education, laws and economics. References:Gay, K. 1990. Water Pollution.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: Write an argument essay supporting or opposing this statement: ‘Reform and other governments from 1911 to 1934 introduced no significant changes in the role of the state’Teacher’s Name: Stevan Eldred-GriggDate: 5th January, 2012Word Count: 667 The role of the state is a most significant part of the New Zealand history. Different parties have different the role of the government. A state can play diverse roles in the people’s lives, such as a big state or small state. In other words, what did the government do for the country or nation? This essay will argue that Reform and other governments in policy, economy and society had changes in the role of the state during 1911 to 1934. New Zealand was controlled by the Reform Party and other governments during 1911 to 1934. Firstly, the Reform Party voted by wealthy people and most of the middle class and then they won controlled the New Zealand government. The Reform state showed a policy called ‘Square Deal’ nickname ‘Square Steal’ caused by it for all social classes beneficial except the working class. As a results, followed by a class war between capitalists and the working class. The war was obviously capitalists won on account of the Reform state support them. Some policies passed hurriedly, for example, Public Safety Conservation Act passed in 1932. Because overseas debt lead to people’s income and standard of living declined, thereby protests and riots grew in New Zealand. However, most of peoples only desire to find a job and make satisfactory money to living. At the same time, Mortgage Corporation held by the government gives cheap a mortgage to farmers and business people who belong to the middle class and capitalists.In addition, the role of the state had no increase in the economic area. Although New Zealand was one of the two or three most affluent countries in the world, the main wealth growth apparently has been experienced by the middle class and capitalists. For instance, cinema, radio, cars and electricity were still controlled by capitalists. Unemployment not a serious problem, but most the working class worried about the lack of jobs. Even though workers who work at electrical and motor factories discovered their incomes increasing, the working class average incomes didn’t grow in this period. Especially, about 17% of the population were unemployment during the Great Depression in the early 1930s. Overseas debt is a major reason makes New Zealand economy made worse. For example, over 40% of government’s revenue was used to pay its debts with interest in 1933. The state established ‘balancing the budget’ in order to solve economic problems, such as reducing state expenditure, borrowing money to invest in the economic growth and tax to rich people. Meanwhile, the working class becomes poor. Finally, the society was no obvious change in the role of the state. The state interfered to assist capitalists through given subsidies and tariffs protected thus help exporters and manufacturers. Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, for example, the state offer free services to the middle class by supplied the capitalists with a modern scientific research institution. The state not only helped the rich people but also helped the poor people. For instance, the state gave pensions to elderly poor people. On the other hand, the state established a new pension which helps injured or sick soldiers by the First World War. Another pension called ‘dole’ merely for Pakeha men during the Great Depression, because women’s pension can provide by her husband or her father and Maori’s pension can provide by their tribes. The pakeha men can get money only if they did some relief work. Consequently, the state established public work schemes, such as building road and tunnel, or forests planting. The aim is to prove that they are not lazy and uneconomical. It is clear that the Reform State and other governments had no significant changes in the role of the state from three aspects - policy, economy and society. Even though the state established some policies or provided welfare for poor people and the working class, they none the less help capitalists and the middle class. People vote for a new government are to get state help and gain profit. References:FNDN025, Unit Three: Role of the State, pp. 41-7. Ball, G. (2004). Making Kiwis.

    <title><![CDATA[Consider the suggestion that genetic technology is wrong]]></title>
    <url>%2F2011%2F12%2F02%2Ffndn1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: Consider the suggestion that genetic technology is wrongTeacher’s Name: Heather RobertsDate: 2nd December, 2011Word Count: 746 Whether or not to allow genetic technology is a controversial issue at the present time. It is usually deals with medicine, agriculture and maintains law and order. This essay will argue that genetic technology is benefits to medicine, agriculture and keep society security. The first benefit area is that genetic technology benefit to medicine. Since genetic engineering is created, it was used in a wide range area, especially in making medicines and medical areas. DNA technology promoted medical science research as well .In the initial period when genetic engineering is published; it was used promptly in medicine research, and tumour transfer. Firstly, genetic engineering can help us understand why people have a disposition to a certain disease and what kind of disease we may get. For example, scientists have identified more than 4000 genetic diseases that may affect human. Secondly, genetic engineering may help doctor research innovative medicines for cure serious diseases. Until now, millions of people already use genetically engineered drugs to treat heart diseases, cancer, AIDS, and strokes (Williams, J. And D. Hill. 2011). Thirdly, genetic experimentation has a critical process in the near future. It is said that the gene system will allow parents select the traits of their children, such as height, weight, and eyes. Obviously, genetic engineering is benefits to human, and already gets good results now. The second benefit area is that genetic technology benefit to agriculture. There are genetic technology benefits to agriculture whether or not to allow genetically modified food is a very controversial issue at the present time. But the genetically modified foods make the food. Need fewer pesticides stay fresh longer and grow better. The primary benefit to agriculture needs fewer pesticides because the genes from plants are taken and joined with other genes from different plant in order to change the original plants. So, it scarcely needs fewer pesticides to kill the bugs, and it will not impact a lot to the human health. For example, the corns kill insects that eat the plants. The additional benefit to agriculture is growing better because the environment is such a complicated system that it is very difficult to determine the effect of any weather, and the gene system is change, so the plant can grow in any weather. For instance, the strawberries can grow in cold weather. The third benefit to agriculture is stays fresh longer because the gene technology, so that makes the food cheaper, and the food in the supermarket will be a higher quality. For example, the tomato can stay fresh for two months (Cox, K. &amp; Hill, D. 2004). The third benefit area is that genetic technology benefit to society safe. Firstly, everyone has a unique DNA that means we can use DNA to identify a distinct person. DNA is located in each of human cells, including blood, saliva, hair follicles, and skin. As a result, police can collect from skin or hair collected a crime scene, then police have a feeling that someone is guilty of it. For example, scientists can analyse the exact makeup of the identical two sets of DNA and there are chances to supply the evidence they are from the same person. The judge could make DNA ‘fingerprints’ to criminal evidence put the person to convince a jury that that person was present at the crime scene. Secondly, DNA evidence is also can help free innocent people. For instance, in January 2001, a man imprisoned for a murder in Texas was released because of DNA tests. Another man, sentenced to death for a murder in Virginia in 1982, was set free in February, because recent evidence based on DNA tests cleared him of the crime (The Human Genome). In addition, genomic technology is good for society safety and additionally can provide evidence to free innocent people. To sum up, the genetic technology has a big impact on our society, though in itself it is neutral. The remarkable technology a society has, the faster the rate at which the society changes. From the essay, it is easy to be seen, the gene has lots of advantages in many areas. The advantage in agriculture is greatly important for us, not only we can keep healthy, and plus we spent less money. Genetic technology will benefit to human continually. I would recommend the government should establish a policy to protect the genetic technology cannot hazardous to human. The genomic technology has become a significant aspect of relations between human and technology. References:Cox, K. &amp; Hill, D (2004) EAP Now. English for Academic Purposes.

    <title><![CDATA[The advantages of a multi-cultural society outweigh the disadvantages]]></title>
    <url>%2F2011%2F08%2F11%2Fepp1%2F</url>
    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: The advantages of a multi-cultural society outweigh the disadvantagesTeacher’s Name: Helen Howarth &amp; Kristen ShannDate: 11st August, 2011Word Count: 766 Mutil-cultural society has been described as a “salad bowl” rather than a “melting pot”. Multicultural is defined in various ways, but the following definition would be acceptable to many people: for or including people of several different races, religions, languages and traditions. [Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary] The term “transculturation” coined by Cuban anthropologist fernando Ortiz in 1940, indicates a transaction of one culture with another. Mary Louise Pratt coined the phrase “the contact zone” to describe cultural clashes and operations.[Multiculturalism from Wikipedia] I think those two different views to display people opinion. Some people think the advantages of a mutlicultural society outweigh the disadvantages, while many others argue that the disadvantages of a mutlicultural society outweigh the advantages. Personally, I am agree with former view. In my opinion, the most western countries are mutlicultural countries for the following two reasons. First, mutlicultural society focuses on interaction and communication bewteen different cultures. Second, multicultural promote national economic growth. The first and most important reason supporting my viewpoint is that mutlicultural society focuses on interaction and communication bewteen different cultures. This means that we use own culture touch to another cultures. For instance, Chinese New Year festival in New Zealand. People might have different backgrounds and cultural traditions but most New Zealanders accept this multicultural New Zealand idea in the last quarter of the 20th century. Multiculturalism allowed the Chinese, some of whose families had been in New Zealand for over a century, to become more open in the display of their culture. [Chinese New Year festival from TeaRa] Chinese community usually celebrates Chinese New Year’s Eve, because we think the first day of the whole year is can influence next year luckiness. New Year in Western cultures can be a lively celebration that lasts from New Year’s Eve to New Year’s Day, but the Chinese New Year Festival can last from five days to three weeks, as a results the importance of Chinese New Year in China equal to Christmas Day in western countries. Decorations are an important part of Chinese New Year. People hang ‘couplets’ on walls and in doorways at home and these are good-luck sayings written on pieces of red paper like put gifts under the Christmas tree. Another interesting example is most kiwis like to visit an Asian restaurant, because New Zealand has absorbed the new culinary tastes of the other countries and combined them with more raditional ones to produce a unique New Zealand identity [New Zealand tourism guide]. The second reason is that multicultural can promote national economic growth. Immigrant play an important role in one country, because most immigrants are skills immigrant. This means that they need hard work to maintain their life. Multicultural society accept new immigrant find a job to get better life like to inject fresh blood in the body and the function is keeping the one country has energy. This state usually happened in developed country, such as Australia, Canada, United States, United Kingdom and New Zealand. [Multiculturalism from Wikipedia] According to a The New Zealand Herald editorial opinion, (April 16, 2011) , Chinese immigrantion was a powerful contributor to the housing boom in the five years to 2007 and China’s growing appetite for Australian and New Zealand export commodities has largely sustained our economies through the global financial crisis [NZherald, 2011]. This situation shows why Chinese focus on house,because they believe house is symbol of family. It is good practice to give this information followed by an example illustrating the point. Another example is Mark Engler (2010) claims that immigrant workers play an important role in building our economy and bolstering institutions such as social security in the US [Mark Engler, 2010]. Some people argue that multicultural society is a behaviour of native culture erosion. For example, the Right Wing Resistance, led by former National Front leader Kyle Chapman is planning an Anti-Asian rally to protest against mass Asian immigrantion, which he claimed “stole jobs” and “destroyed white New Zealand culture and heritage”. [Lincoin Tan, 2011] While it is ture that multicultural makes minority culture gradnally disappear. However, I believe that it is important for multicultural to make people is aware of uniqueness of minority culture , because people will focus on protecting the diversity of culture. Furthermore , multicultural combine with minority culture become a special culture in the future. This means that the new special culture have double cultural status – minority culture and multicultural. Even though multicultural society make minority culture gradually disappear, overall I believe the advantages of a multicultural society outweigh the disadvantages. I would advise the government makers establish multicultural community and protect minority culture policy. I believe it is essential to bulid a international metropolis.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: The advantages of urbanisation outweigh the disadvantagesTeacher’s Name: Helen HowarthDate: 11 April, 2011Word Count: 682 Urbanisation is the direction of most country’s development. Urbanisation defined by the United Nations as movement of people from rural to urban areas with population growth equating to urban migration. In the contemporary world, urbanisation is advancing at an amazing speed in present-day society. For example, China’s urbanization rate is 46.59% in 2009, which means almost half of the rural area became urban area this year. Urbanisation is playing a significant role in our lives. But in the meantime, whether urbanisation has sparked much debate. Some people assert that the advantages of urbanisation outweigh the disadvantages, while many others argue that urbanisation disadvantages than advantages. Personally, I am in favor of the former view. In my opinion, urbanisation is the natural process of human evolution, because humans want to live in a better environment with greater facilities and opportunities and enjoy a better condition of social material life, and the most important reason is urbanization promote the economic growth (Wikipedia–urbanization).The first and most important reason supporting my view is that urbanisation benefits our life. Urbanisation makes the benefits of facilities and opportunities available to us. This means that people can get knowledge from libraries and museums, and improve the knowledge of people to find a better job. Another opportunity is women’s education effect. For instance, in China, before the urbanisation, people cannot get enough knowledge to bring them to higher education which lead to a slower development. The effect of education for women is an example of the benefit from these opportunities. According to the Demographic and Health Surveys (2003~2006), women’s education leads to different family size. For example, in 2003, in the Philippines the total fertility rate for women with no education was 5.3, for women with primary school education it was 5.0, but for women with secondary or higher education it was 3.1 ( Human Population: Women, 2006).The second reason is that the development of urbanisation contributes to economic growth. According to economists, at present, China’s urbanisation rate is less than 46%, while that of developed countries mostly stands above 90 %. It means one percentage point of increase in China’s urbanisation rate will promote over 10 million rural residents to move to urban area. Meanwhile, despite the fall in rural population, the agricultural output will continue to grow thanks to increased agricultural productivity, which can help to sustain China’s relatively high economic growth rate. Because they will require housing, education and employment, this will in turn bring about massive construction projects, such as apartment, school and factory. For this reason, urbanisation can make the economic growth. (Consumption and urbanization to drive China’s economy, 2009)Some people argue that the disadvantages of urbanisation outweigh the advantages, because the development of urbanisation has also brought pollution and poverty. It is true that urbanisation has bad aspects. For example, Bangkok in Thailand, there are many motorcycles, cars and buses on the city’s street. All of these cars and motorcycles are a major cause of air pollution and heavy traffic in this city. Poverty is a huge problem in Cairo, Egypt where the population doubled between 1980 and 2000 to about 18 million residents and 50% of new residents live in slums. However, there are issues that can be solved. Investment is one way of solving the poverty and environment, because people don’t have enough money to improve their. “However, in some places, trends are changing.” report says. Architects, engineer, and politicians are starting to designing new cities that are environmentally smart. Design principles for “smart growth”, including smaller communities with parks and gardens, and efficient public transportation. In China, the government has a sustainable development policy, which means before the development of business, the government will estimate its actual function and influence. (McEntire, J. &amp;Williams, J, 2009)In conclusion, while urbanisation has some problems, it’s still clear that urbanisation will continue development. I would recommend the use of technology to bring the urbanisation development along. If we do this, our world will become a modern metropolis where have a lot of parks and convenient transport facilities. References: McEntire, J. &amp;Williams, J.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: When learning another language it is important to learn about the culture of people who speak that languageTeacher’s Name: Joanne ThamDate: 10th December, 2010Word Count: 686 To possess a second language is to possess a second soul. And culture means the widening of the mind and of the spirit. In the present age, learning another language is important to learn about the culture of the people who speak that language. But in the meantime, the questions whether learning about the culture to learn another language has sparked much debate. In my opinion, when learning another language it is very important to learn about the culture of its learners for two reasons. Firstly, the culture is part of language.Secondly, the culture will help you to learn about language and grasp the language more quickly. First, convincing arguments can be made that the culture is part of language. Unless you can understand how language is used, e.g. accents, religion, traditions, music and food, then you are missing out on the biggest part of learning. Of course you can just learn grammar, but sooner or later you want to actually talk to someone, then what are you going to do? Culture provides the catalyst for language teaching and learning, University Sains Malaysia vice-chancellor Professor Datuk Dzulkifli Abdul Razak said. As language evolved through culture and civilization, learning its historical aspect would greatly help in understanding and learning the various languages. As a result, he said, language and culture should therefore be integrated well in the teaching and learning processes. I have found this to be true a culture is part of language. For example, when I talked with native speakers, they will talk some sports, foods and places, I usually didn’t understand it. This example illustrates how important of culture is to learn another language.And second reason to support my viewpoint is that the culture will help to language learner to learn language quickly. According to Kluckhohn (1961), language is a culture’s orientation to time. It means language is the culture of the time positioning. As we know the cultures have past-oriented, present-oriented or future-oriented. It was different attitude to describes the degree to which the culture values the past, the present or the future. For example, in Chinese, people use “old” to describe old people, but my English teacher told me in western countries people use “senior” to describe them.But some people against that language learner learning another language need to learn about the culture. I don’t think that it is really possible to separate language and culture. In my mind, they are in an interdependent relationship whereby culture influences language and language influences culture. For example, some courses, some specialists and some sports. While it is true that might use English only to read and write essay in English. I think in some specialized subjects are will need to learn about culture. For example, the architecture is needs to learn about national history and national culture. Because the structure is along with the different culture to change style. For accurate, different dynasties has different structure style. For example, the Imperial palace is have Ming dynasty style and the Temple of Heaven in Beijing is have Qing dynasty. Though those two buildings are identical places, but its had different styles. In a word, I think study architecture require to learn about culture in order to understand different style. Therefore, I think learning about culture is learning about soul and widening of the mind. In summary, while some language learners think it about culture is significant of a learn of language. It was still clear that learning another language it is important to learn about the culture of people who speak that language. I would advise all language learners to learn about culture. Overall, I am convinced language learners to learn about a culture of language learner. I suppose when learning another language, and make we couldn’t learning get well. In fact, many language schools teaching languages are also learning their own culture at now. References: Matikainen, T. &amp;Duffy, C.B. (2000).Developing cultural understanding.
