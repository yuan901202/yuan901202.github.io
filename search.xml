    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: The advantages of a multi-cultural society outweigh the disadvantagesTeacher’s Name: Helen Howarth &amp; Kristen ShannDate: 11st August, 2011Word Count: 766Mutil-cultural society has been described as a “salad bowl” rather than a “melting pot”. Multicultural is defined in various ways, but the following definition would be acceptable to many people: for or including people of several different races, religions, languages and traditions. [Oxford Advanced Learner’s Dictionary] The term “transculturation” coined by Cuban anthropologist fernando Ortiz in 1940, indicates a transaction of one culture with another. Mary Louise Pratt coined the phrase “the contact zone” to describe cultural clashes and operations.[Multiculturalism from Wikipedia] I think those two different views to display people opinion. Some people think the advantages of a mutlicultural society outweigh the disadvantages, while many others argue that the disadvantages of a mutlicultural society outweigh the advantages. Personally, I am agree with former view. In my opinion, the most western countries are mutlicultural countries for the following two reasons. First, mutlicultural society focuses on interaction and communication bewteen different cultures. Second, multicultural promote national economic growth. The first and most important reason supporting my viewpoint is that mutlicultural society focuses on interaction and communication bewteen different cultures. This means that we use own culture touch to another cultures. For instance, Chinese New Year festival in New Zealand. People might have different backgrounds and cultural traditions but most New Zealanders accept this multicultural New Zealand idea in the last quarter of the 20th century. Multiculturalism allowed the Chinese, some of whose families had been in New Zealand for over a century, to become more open in the display of their culture. [Chinese New Year festival from TeaRa] Chinese community usually celebrates Chinese New Year’s Eve, because we think the first day of the whole year is can influence next year luckiness. New Year in Western cultures can be a lively celebration that lasts from New Year’s Eve to New Year’s Day, but the Chinese New Year Festival can last from five days to three weeks, as a results the importance of Chinese New Year in China equal to Christmas Day in western countries. Decorations are an important part of Chinese New Year. People hang ‘couplets’ on walls and in doorways at home and these are good-luck sayings written on pieces of red paper like put gifts under the Christmas tree. Another interesting example is most kiwis like to visit an Asian restaurant, because New Zealand has absorbed the new culinary tastes of the other countries and combined them with more raditional ones to produce a unique New Zealand identity [New Zealand tourism guide]. The second reason is that multicultural can promote national economic growth. Immigrant play an important role in one country, because most immigrants are skills immigrant. This means that they need hard work to maintain their life. Multicultural society accept new immigrant find a job to get better life like to inject fresh blood in the body and the function is keeping the one country has energy. This state usually happened in developed country, such as Australia, Canada, United States, United Kingdom and New Zealand. [Multiculturalism from Wikipedia] According to a The New Zealand Herald editorial opinion, (April 16, 2011) , Chinese immigrantion was a powerful contributor to the housing boom in the five years to 2007 and China’s growing appetite for Australian and New Zealand export commodities has largely sustained our economies through the global financial crisis [NZherald, 2011]. This situation shows why Chinese focus on house,because they believe house is symbol of family. It is good practice to give this information followed by an example illustrating the point. Another example is Mark Engler (2010) claims that immigrant workers play an important role in building our economy and bolstering institutions such as social security in the US [Mark Engler, 2010]. Some people argue that multicultural society is a behaviour of native culture erosion. For example, the Right Wing Resistance, led by former National Front leader Kyle Chapman is planning an Anti-Asian rally to protest against mass Asian immigrantion, which he claimed “stole jobs” and “destroyed white New Zealand culture and heritage”. [Lincoin Tan, 2011] While it is ture that multicultural makes minority culture gradnally disappear. However, I believe that it is important for multicultural to make people is aware of uniqueness of minority culture , because people will focus on protecting the diversity of culture. Furthermore , multicultural combine with minority culture become a special culture in the future. This means that the new special culture have double cultural status – minority culture and multicultural. Even though multicultural society make minority culture gradually disappear, overall I believe the advantages of a multicultural society outweigh the disadvantages. I would advise the government makers establish multicultural community and protect minority culture policy. I believe it is essential to bulid a international metropolis. If this is not done, achieved international metropolis is impossible.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: The advantages of urbanisation outweigh the disadvantagesTeacher’s Name: Helen HowarthDate: 11 April, 2011Word Count: 682Urbanisation is the direction of most country’s development. Urbanisation defined by the United Nations as movement of people from rural to urban areas with population growth equating to urban migration. In the contemporary world, urbanisation is advancing at an amazing speed in present-day society. For example, China’s urbanization rate is 46.59% in 2009, which means almost half of the rural area became urban area this year. Urbanisation is playing a significant role in our lives. But in the meantime, whether urbanisation has sparked much debate. Some people assert that the advantages of urbanisation outweigh the disadvantages, while many others argue that urbanisation disadvantages than advantages. Personally, I am in favor of the former view. In my opinion, urbanisation is the natural process of human evolution, because humans want to live in a better environment with greater facilities and opportunities and enjoy a better condition of social material life, and the most important reason is urbanization promote the economic growth (Wikipedia–urbanization).The first and most important reason supporting my view is that urbanisation benefits our life. Urbanisation makes the benefits of facilities and opportunities available to us. This means that people can get knowledge from libraries and museums, and improve the knowledge of people to find a better job. Another opportunity is women’s education effect. For instance, in China, before the urbanisation, people cannot get enough knowledge to bring them to higher education which lead to a slower development. The effect of education for women is an example of the benefit from these opportunities. According to the Demographic and Health Surveys (2003~2006), women’s education leads to different family size. For example, in 2003, in the Philippines the total fertility rate for women with no education was 5.3, for women with primary school education it was 5.0, but for women with secondary or higher education it was 3.1 ( Human Population: Women, 2006).The second reason is that the development of urbanisation contributes to economic growth. According to economists, at present, China’s urbanisation rate is less than 46%, while that of developed countries mostly stands above 90 %. It means one percentage point of increase in China’s urbanisation rate will promote over 10 million rural residents to move to urban area. Meanwhile, despite the fall in rural population, the agricultural output will continue to grow thanks to increased agricultural productivity, which can help to sustain China’s relatively high economic growth rate. Because they will require housing, education and employment, this will in turn bring about massive construction projects, such as apartment, school and factory. For this reason, urbanisation can make the economic growth. (Consumption and urbanization to drive China’s economy, 2009)Some people argue that the disadvantages of urbanisation outweigh the advantages, because the development of urbanisation has also brought pollution and poverty. It is true that urbanisation has bad aspects. For example, Bangkok in Thailand, there are many motorcycles, cars and buses on the city’s street. All of these cars and motorcycles are a major cause of air pollution and heavy traffic in this city. Poverty is a huge problem in Cairo, Egypt where the population doubled between 1980 and 2000 to about 18 million residents and 50% of new residents live in slums. However, there are issues that can be solved. Investment is one way of solving the poverty and environment, because people don’t have enough money to improve their. “However, in some places, trends are changing.” report says. Architects, engineer, and politicians are starting to designing new cities that are environmentally smart. Design principles for “smart growth”, including smaller communities with parks and gardens, and efficient public transportation. In China, the government has a sustainable development policy, which means before the development of business, the government will estimate its actual function and influence. (McEntire, J. &amp;Williams, J, 2009)In conclusion, while urbanisation has some problems, it’s still clear that urbanisation will continue development. I would recommend the use of technology to bring the urbanisation development along. If we do this, our world will become a modern metropolis where have a lot of parks and convenient transport facilities. References: McEntire, J. &amp;Williams, J.

    <content type="text"><![CDATA[Topic: When learning another language it is important to learn about the culture of people who speak that languageTeacher’s Name: Joanne ThamDate: 10th December, 2010Word Count: 686To possess a second language is to possess a second soul. And culture means the widening of the mind and of the spirit. In the present age, learning another language is important to learn about the culture of the people who speak that language. But in the meantime, the questions whether learning about the culture to learn another language has sparked much debate. In my opinion, when learning another language it is very important to learn about the culture of its learners for two reasons. Firstly, the culture is part of language.Secondly, the culture will help you to learn about language and grasp the language more quickly. First, convincing arguments can be made that the culture is part of language. Unless you can understand how language is used, e.g. accents, religion, traditions, music and food, then you are missing out on the biggest part of learning. Of course you can just learn grammar, but sooner or later you want to actually talk to someone, then what are you going to do? Culture provides the catalyst for language teaching and learning, University Sains Malaysia vice-chancellor Professor Datuk Dzulkifli Abdul Razak said. As language evolved through culture and civilization, learning its historical aspect would greatly help in understanding and learning the various languages. As a result, he said, language and culture should therefore be integrated well in the teaching and learning processes. I have found this to be true a culture is part of language. For example, when I talked with native speakers, they will talk some sports, foods and places, I usually didn’t understand it. This example illustrates how important of culture is to learn another language.And second reason to support my viewpoint is that the culture will help to language learner to learn language quickly. According to Kluckhohn (1961), language is a culture’s orientation to time. It means language is the culture of the time positioning. As we know the cultures have past-oriented, present-oriented or future-oriented. It was different attitude to describes the degree to which the culture values the past, the present or the future. For example, in Chinese, people use “old” to describe old people, but my English teacher told me in western countries people use “senior” to describe them.But some people against that language learner learning another language need to learn about the culture. I don’t think that it is really possible to separate language and culture. In my mind, they are in an interdependent relationship whereby culture influences language and language influences culture. For example, some courses, some specialists and some sports. While it is true that might use English only to read and write essay in English. I think in some specialized subjects are will need to learn about culture. For example, the architecture is needs to learn about national history and national culture. Because the structure is along with the different culture to change style. For accurate, different dynasties has different structure style. For example, the Imperial palace is have Ming dynasty style and the Temple of Heaven in Beijing is have Qing dynasty. Though those two buildings are identical places, but its had different styles. In a word, I think study architecture require to learn about culture in order to understand different style. Therefore, I think learning about culture is learning about soul and widening of the mind. In summary, while some language learners think it about culture is significant of a learn of language. It was still clear that learning another language it is important to learn about the culture of people who speak that language. I would advise all language learners to learn about culture. Overall, I am convinced language learners to learn about a culture of language learner. I suppose when learning another language, and make we couldn’t learning get well. In fact, many language schools teaching languages are also learning their own culture at now. References: Matikainen, T. &amp;Duffy, C.B. (2000).Developing cultural understanding.
